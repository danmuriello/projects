5:18:51 PM talktotim86: prob question
5:18:57 PM gogogadgetdano: go
5:18:57 PM talktotim86: so check it
5:19:07 PM talktotim86: i want to do a shit ton of calculations
5:19:14 PM gogogadgetdano: k
5:19:29 PM talktotim86: so that i can calculate the information gain of a keyword
5:19:37 PM talktotim86: but barre that for a sec
5:19:37 PM gogogadgetdano (Autoreply): new photos!
http://www.flickr.com/photos/dan0
5:20:14 PM talktotim86: i am stuck on how to calculate p(A|B) for a bunch of frequencies of words
5:21:10 PM gogogadgetdano: well you know that p(A|B) = p(A&B)/p(B)
5:21:26 PM gogogadgetdano: so find out how often they occur together
5:21:28 PM talktotim86: right
5:21:33 PM gogogadgetdano: then find out how often the second one occurs
5:21:35 PM gogogadgetdano: and divide
5:21:37 PM talktotim86: how do i calc P(a and b)
5:22:01 PM gogogadgetdano: find the number of articles that have both the word 'a' as well as 'b'
5:22:12 PM gogogadgetdano: divide that by the total number of articles
5:22:14 PM talktotim86: shit
5:22:17 PM talktotim86: hahahhahahahaha]
5:22:23 PM gogogadgetdano: did you just toss everything into one bag?
5:22:27 PM talktotim86: for real?
5:22:30 PM gogogadgetdano: yeah
5:23:10 PM talktotim86: what if the word shows up more than once?
5:23:45 PM gogogadgetdano: doesn't matter
5:24:16 PM talktotim86: count it once?
5:24:22 PM gogogadgetdano: yes
5:24:36 PM talktotim86: hrmm

4:23:29 PM talktotim86: spelling corrector is really cool
4:23:44 PM talktotim86: it only supports and edit distance of 1
4:24:30 PM talktotim86: ie: one transposition, letter missing, letter addition, and alternation
4:24:52 PM talktotim86: i statistical language processing is really cool
4:25:10 PM talktotim86: espcially with and incredible resource like the internet
4:26:26 PM talktotim86: 16786 spelling errors in 30602 words
4:26:43 PM talktotim86: 35178**** words
4:27:00 PM talktotim86: 10676 words where in the thesaurus
4:27:12 PM talktotim86: for those 35178
4:27:51 PM talktotim86: well maybe after fixing the spelling errors the thesarus will be more usefull

9:09:49 PM talktotim86: actually, after retesting... its not that good
9:09:55 PM talktotim86: its actually pretty bad
9:09:59 PM gogogadgetdano: 
9:10:03 PM gogogadgetdano: are you doing bag of words?
9:10:04 PM talktotim86: more like 38% error
9:10:12 PM talktotim86: yeah, but a small bag
9:10:16 PM gogogadgetdano: getting rid of the words that appear similarly in both?
9:10:24 PM talktotim86: and a lot of the words prolly don't make anysense
9:10:31 PM talktotim86: nope
9:10:33 PM gogogadgetdano: are they actual words?
9:10:44 PM talktotim86: hell if i know
9:10:51 PM talktotim86: its statistical
9:10:59 PM gogogadgetdano: hmm
9:11:10 PM gogogadgetdano: what's the input vector to the neural network consist of?
9:11:10 PM talktotim86: if they show up enough.. they must be important
9:11:24 PM talktotim86: the presence of a word
9:11:34 PM talktotim86: there are 400 words in the bag
9:11:50 PM talktotim86: i think i need make it a lot bigger
9:11:54 PM talktotim86: like 3000
9:11:54 PM gogogadgetdano: hmm, considering that those are words, that is a pretty small bag
9:11:56 PM gogogadgetdano: yeah
9:12:11 PM gogogadgetdano: does that just mean more training data?
9:12:23 PM talktotim86: a bit
9:12:29 PM talktotim86: i need a bigger bag
9:12:35 PM gogogadgetdano: do you want some help?
9:12:36 PM talktotim86: much bigger bag
9:12:39 PM talktotim86: anda smarter bag
9:12:51 PM gogogadgetdano: i mean, is there anything i could do to help?
9:13:04 PM talktotim86: i have all the data being grabbed via scrape
9:13:09 PM talktotim86: lots of regex
9:13:11 PM gogogadgetdano: oh, the scrape works?
9:13:17 PM talktotim86: yeah
9:13:19 PM gogogadgetdano: i would imagine it would be a shitload of regex
9:13:26 PM talktotim86: i would never make data by hand
9:13:35 PM gogogadgetdano: i still haven't done a real regex
9:13:37 PM talktotim86: its not that bad..
9:13:37 PM gogogadgetdano: i gotta do that
9:13:43 PM gogogadgetdano: i just need to fuckin do it
9:14:10 PM talktotim86: i think that my tests are a bit bogus
9:14:22 PM talktotim86: basically heres what happens:
9:14:23 PM gogogadgetdano: what do they do?
9:14:25 PM gogogadgetdano: k
9:14:41 PM talktotim86: http://www.metacritic.com/film/
9:14:59 PM talktotim86: all links to movie pages on this page are crawled to
9:15:15 PM talktotim86: so that left hand column
9:15:24 PM talktotim86: "Wide Release..."
9:15:28 PM talktotim86: all those movies
9:15:38 PM talktotim86: and even further down
9:15:47 PM talktotim86: then when it looks at each page
9:15:57 PM talktotim86: http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/28weekslater
9:16:17 PM talktotim86: i grabs the usercomments at the bottom
9:16:25 PM talktotim86: and thier ratings
9:16:28 PM talktotim86: and blurb
9:17:08 PM gogogadgetdano: that's the test, or that's the scrape?
9:18:07 PM talktotim86: so when its creates the input vector (one dimension for each entry in the bag of words ) it scans the blurb and makes the present words 1 on the vector
9:18:13 PM talktotim86: this is the scrape
9:18:21 PM gogogadgetdano: ok, right
9:18:39 PM talktotim86: and if the rating is >= 7 it is seen as a good review
9:19:06 PM talktotim86: so i get all this data like this
9:19:07 PM gogogadgetdano: >=7?
9:19:11 PM gogogadgetdano: that's not a good metric
9:19:17 PM talktotim86: and i use 75% of it to test
9:19:26 PM gogogadgetdano: huh?
9:19:41 PM talktotim86: well if i use 5 i get hardly any bad reviews
9:20:01 PM gogogadgetdano: i'm saying you should make it >=40 at least
9:20:08 PM gogogadgetdano: because these are out of 100 right?
9:20:10 PM talktotim86: its 0-10
9:20:11 PM gogogadgetdano: or are they out of 10?
9:20:12 PM gogogadgetdano: oh
9:20:14 PM talktotim86: user reviews
9:20:16 PM gogogadgetdano: then 7 is fine, sorry
9:20:17 PM gogogadgetdano: oh yeah
9:20:18 PM talktotim86: not critics
9:20:21 PM talktotim86: yeah
9:20:27 PM talktotim86: maybe a 6 is better
9:21:00 PM gogogadgetdano: try it
9:21:19 PM talktotim86: but think about this:
9:21:34 PM talktotim86: if it is more probable for a a review to be good
9:21:50 PM talktotim86: then my data is not gonna be too good
9:21:51 PM gogogadgetdano: true
9:22:11 PM gogogadgetdano: i'd say people who disliked the movie are just as motivated, if not more, to write up a user review on metacritic
9:22:36 PM gogogadgetdano: but something to think about is that people who go to it in the first place are more likely to like it, because they shelled out money for the ticket
9:22:44 PM talktotim86: im not gonna jump to assumptions
9:22:45 PM gogogadgetdano: so i say 7 is good
9:22:50 PM talktotim86: haha
9:23:04 PM talktotim86: maybe another problem is that these are mostly new movies....
9:23:06 PM talktotim86: grrr
9:23:19 PM talktotim86: so things to do are: better bag of words
9:23:28 PM gogogadgetdano: i feel like these things are something that shouldn't be coming into play at this stage in development
9:23:37 PM talktotim86: and more diverse training data
9:24:36 PM talktotim86: project name is ebert
9:24:42 PM gogogadgetdano: agreed
9:24:48 PM talktotim86: 
9:24:52 PM gogogadgetdano: excellent
9:25:36 PM talktotim86: you gotta see some of this code
9:25:43 PM talktotim86: its pretty good
9:26:48 PM gogogadgetdano: i wanna
9:26:55 PM talktotim86: another thing that is not so good is that i am getter my bag of words from rottentomatoes
9:27:19 PM talktotim86: i realized only today that metacritic is a far better website to mine
9:27:32 PM gogogadgetdano: they're so organized
9:27:44 PM gogogadgetdano: it's designed really well
9:28:17 PM talktotim86: it well structured
9:28:28 PM talktotim86: what his ass would like it
9:28:33 PM talktotim86: prof. chang

9:29:12 PM talktotim86: omfg
9:29:17 PM talktotim86: what a weirdo
9:29:21 PM gogogadgetdano: so, here's what i put down for numbers:

9:29:25 PM gogogadgetdano: computer vision: 1

4:38:28 PM talktotim86: so
4:38:36 PM talktotim86: if we want a GUI
4:38:44 PM talktotim86: there is a cross platform issue
4:39:01 PM talktotim86: the AIM client will work on OSX
4:39:03 PM talktotim86: but
4:39:09 PM talktotim86: if we want to make a GUI
4:39:25 PM talktotim86: idk how to do that
4:39:27 PM talktotim86: in c++
4:39:36 PM gogogadgetdano: arrrg
4:39:40 PM talktotim86: there might be a cross platform c++ gui framework
4:39:42 PM talktotim86: yeah
4:39:47 PM talktotim86: its a kink in the plan
4:39:49 PM gogogadgetdano: i thought there was
4:40:18 PM talktotim86: i am open to using different game engines
4:40:26 PM talktotim86: i would hate to do think think in java
4:40:30 PM talktotim86: actually
4:40:36 PM talktotim86: we could use allegro
4:40:46 PM gogogadgetdano: i say no java
4:40:51 PM gogogadgetdano: we should avoid java at all costs
4:40:54 PM talktotim86: yes
4:41:04 PM talktotim86: alright here is the idea
4:41:31 PM talktotim86: the game engine that we use needs to have typing functionality
4:41:42 PM talktotim86: we have to be able to type shit into a box or something
4:41:52 PM talktotim86: it's prolly available in HGE
4:42:05 PM talktotim86: you need to see if HGE will compile on your shit
4:53:46 PM talktotim86: check this one out: http://www.ogre3d.org/
4:56:07 PM gogogadgetdano: that's a different game engine?
4:56:11 PM talktotim86: yeah
4:56:19 PM talktotim86: i think that its more powerful
4:56:24 PM talktotim86: its uspports 3d stuff
4:56:27 PM talktotim86: and network play
4:56:31 PM talktotim86: but
4:56:38 PM talktotim86: i like the AIM idea a lot
4:56:47 PM talktotim86: i think that Brandt liked it too
4:59:05 PM gogogadgetdano: hmm
4:59:15 PM gogogadgetdano: if it supports network play, then it supports network play, if ya know what i mean
4:59:48 PM talktotim86: well i know that is what Vlad is using in his game
4:59:49 PM talktotim86: but
4:59:57 PM talktotim86: it might be some other library + OGRE
5:00:18 PM talktotim86: http://hge.relishgames.com
5:00:32 PM talktotim86: see if it works on OSx
5:00:48 PM talktotim86: try to find something for xcode
5:00:52 PM talktotim86: so that you can compile it
5:01:33 PM gogogadgetdano: what am i supposed to compile?
5:01:52 PM talktotim86: the engine
5:02:01 PM talktotim86: try to run one of the tutorials
5:02:01 PM gogogadgetdano: if what i'm supposed to compile has anything to do with.dll files, then we're out of luck

2:48:24 PM gogogadgetdano: you're saying something isn't real because it's not what you would expect to be real
2:48:27 PM talktotim86: NASA say that naive is written on saturns rings
2:51:31 PM gogogadgetdano: whatev, you've got the right to be skeptical, and i've got the right to think you're stubborn

3:43:32 PM talktotim86: waiting on JSON
3:43:35 PM gogogadgetdano: nice
3:43:47 PM talktotim86: i need to write a function to call getPhoto on each keyword
3:43:57 PM talktotim86: that is returned by yahoo!
3:45:19 PM gogogadgetdano: do you know how to pull the keywords out of the json object yet?
3:45:25 PM talktotim86: nope
3:45:27 PM gogogadgetdano: because that's what i'm on
3:45:35 PM talktotim86: werd
3:46:43 PM gogogadgetdano: ah, so you got flickr returning a json object too
3:46:55 PM talktotim86: yup
3:49:10 PM gogogadgetdano: it looks like the flickr json object is getting chopped off at the front
3:49:25 PM talktotim86: thats just displaying them
3:49:28 PM talktotim86: is fucked up
3:49:40 PM gogogadgetdano: goddamnit

3:59:42 PM talktotim86: how do i get chicken pot pie
3:59:56 PM gogogadgetdano: that's what i'm trying to figure out
4:00:03 PM gogogadgetdano: you make a parseJSON call
4:05:00 PM talktotim86: go to getKeywordsFromUserContentCallback() in ultils.js
4:05:13 PM gogogadgetdano: k
4:05:17 PM talktotim86: and try to get a keyword to alert
4:05:26 PM gogogadgetdano: that's actually exactly what i'm doing
4:05:33 PM talktotim86: werd
4:05:39 PM gogogadgetdano: you say "alert(mything)" to display mything right?
4:06:44 PM talktotim86: yea
4:08:04 PM talktotim86:     alert(resultsObj.ResultSet.Result[1].toJSONString());
4:08:06 PM talktotim86: got it
4:08:26 PM gogogadgetdano: fuck yeah
4:09:28 PM gogogadgetdano: oh yeah
4:09:30 PM gogogadgetdano: i feel that
4:13:33 PM gogogadgetdano: to see the entire jsonstring from flickr, just throw in:
4:13:52 PM gogogadgetdano: document.write(resultsObj.toJSONString());
4:14:04 PM talktotim86: var i = 0;
    while(resultsObj.ResultSet.Result[i]) {
        alert(resultsObj.ResultSet.Result[i].toJSONString());
        i++;
    }
talk to TIM 86<!-- (4:11:43 PM)-->: add that to getKeywordsFromUserContentCallback

you can call getPhotos(resultsObj.ResultSet.Result[i].toJSONString())
4:16:03 PM talktotim86: give me an expression for making an IMG
4:16:13 PM talktotim86: from the flickr JSON response

12:37:43 AM talktotim86: yeah
12:38:36 AM gogogadgetdano: i've been writing a bit of music recently
12:38:42 AM talktotim86: cool

12:39:00 AM talktotim86: cool

12:39:21 AM gogogadgetdano: hell yeah
12:39:22 AM gogogadgetdano: go for ti
12:39:35 AM talktotim86: because just piano can be not so complete
12:39:48 AM gogogadgetdano: same with guitar
12:40:52 AM talktotim86: its easier to make a very intricate piano sonata then a guitar one
12:41:05 AM gogogadgetdano: certainly
12:41:14 AM talktotim86: 10 fingers
12:41:22 AM gogogadgetdano: that's why instrumental guitar isn't a complete sound at all
12:41:27 AM talktotim86: yeah
12:41:34 AM talktotim86: piano can be
12:41:38 AM gogogadgetdano: there are barely any solo guitar instrumental pieces out there
12:41:52 AM gogogadgetdano: while the greatest musicians to ever live wrote solo piano sonatas

12:42:54 AM talktotim86: rachmaninoff.. oi vei
12:43:17 AM gogogadgetdano: exactly

12:44:16 AM talktotim86: instead of just fucking around
12:44:18 AM talktotim86: like i do
12:44:29 AM talktotim86: i think that would help me a lot
12:45:19 AM gogogadgetdano: totally, that's what took my playing to the next level
12:45:42 AM gogogadgetdano: not that i'm on some sort of amazing level right now, but back in high school, when i started writing real songs, i got alot better
12:45:56 AM talktotim86: yeah
12:55:48 AM talktotim86: you still wanna try and make some music?
12:56:11 AM talktotim86: have you heard "An evening with John Petrucci and Jordan Ruddess"

11:10:07 PM talktotim86: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism
Tim Vieira came back (11:10:08 PM)
11:11:01 PM talktotim86: i wonder if the problem with the computer telling you that you where you will be in the future
11:11:19 PM talktotim86: is more fatalism than determinism
11:13:50 PM talktotim86: i think asking the computer where you will be in the future will cause it to go into a loop until the time (in the future) passes
11:14:06 PM gogogadgetdano: hmm
11:14:10 PM talktotim86: and not be able to give you and answer
11:14:10 PM gogogadgetdano: interesting perspective
11:14:25 PM talktotim86: given that the algorithm is absolute
11:14:25 PM gogogadgetdano: then is it true that you can't know what will happen until it acutally happens
11:14:47 PM gogogadgetdano: therefore: it is impossible to absolutely predict the future
11:14:47 PM talktotim86: actually
11:15:49 PM talktotim86: if you will try to do other than the computer says, it could cause a loop
11:16:11 PM talktotim86: i could look up where you will be tomorrow
11:16:15 PM talktotim86: and not tell you
11:16:20 PM talktotim86: and you will be there tomorrow
11:16:28 PM talktotim86: and id laff
11:19:06 PM gogogadgetdano: haha
11:19:21 PM gogogadgetdano: brb
11:19:25 PM talktotim86: ok
11:23:58 PM gogogadgetdano: i'm gonna make some muffins

8:34:09 PM gogogadgetdano: hey, what's the difference between union-by-height and union-by-size?
8:34:24 PM talktotim86: oooooo
8:34:43 PM talktotim86: what type of tree is this?
8:35:33 PM gogogadgetdano: this is part b from the analysis problem in the first sample exam
8:35:41 PM gogogadgetdano: it says "assume you have a disjoint set structure"
8:36:03 PM talktotim86: disjoint sets are not on the test
8:36:11 PM gogogadgetdano: ok, good then
8:36:15 PM talktotim86: yeah
8:36:27 PM gogogadgetdano: but anyway, what's the difference between uionbyheight and unionbysize?
8:36:44 PM talktotim86: preference
8:36:58 PM gogogadgetdano: well, they do different things dont they?
8:37:00 PM talktotim86: if you like keeping track of crap

Tim Vieira became active (9:48:15 PM)
9:50:07 PM talktotim86: if you had sex 365 times in a year and melted all the condoms into a tire what would you call it?
9:50:14 PM talktotim86: a fucking good year
9:57:32 PM gogogadgetdano: L
9:57:33 PM gogogadgetdano: O
9:57:34 PM gogogadgetdano: L
9:57:49 PM talktotim86: ha
9:58:04 PM gogogadgetdano: did you make that up?
9:58:18 PM talktotim86: no
10:01:17 PM talktotim86: what is there to know about iterators?
10:01:36 PM talktotim86: and inheritance
10:01:45 PM gogogadgetdano: ok, iterators are basically wrappers for pointers
10:01:49 PM talktotim86: i could see like short answer questions
10:01:53 PM gogogadgetdano: yeah
10:01:53 PM talktotim86: yeah
10:02:14 PM gogogadgetdano: iterators carry with them a pointer and methods for interacting with that pointer according to their specific data structure
10:02:50 PM gogogadgetdano: like, you can call the ++ operator on an iterator and it will move forward one element, regardless of the type of structure
10:03:06 PM talktotim86: and those methods are normally like operator++ and operator=
10:03:09 PM talktotim86: haha
10:03:10 PM talktotim86: yeah
10:03:39 PM gogogadgetdano: and when you have iterators, you also have built-in 'begin' and 'end' functions
10:03:46 PM gogogadgetdano: for use when you're initializing your iterators
10:03:54 PM talktotim86: yeah
10:19:19 PM talktotim86: what do you think that he will ask about inheritance?
10:19:41 PM gogogadgetdano: shit, i don't rightly know
10:19:52 PM gogogadgetdano: but now's a great time to review it

9:22:38 PM talktotim86: and your computer

10:09:33 PM gogogadgetdano: i'm testing it right now, mutherfucker
10:09:39 PM talktotim86: nice
10:09:43 PM gogogadgetdano: creating new arrays of new types, doing shit to em
10:09:54 PM talktotim86: make a birthday thing
10:10:05 PM gogogadgetdano: goood idea
10:10:07 PM talktotim86: yeah

10:10:39 PM talktotim86: 21*
10:10:41 PM talktotim86: oops
10:30:29 PM gogogadgetdano: this shit is working so well
10:30:44 PM talktotim86: awesome
10:30:50 PM talktotim86: exacamundo?
10:30:58 PM talktotim86: prefectamundo?
10:31:08 PM gogogadgetdano: so far
10:31:28 PM gogogadgetdano: i think i want to change some of these for loops to finditem or findfirstsatisfier calls
10:31:46 PM gogogadgetdano: because in the implementation notes they say to use existing functions and given code WHENEVER possible
10:32:16 PM gogogadgetdano: but for the shit where we're checking more than one condition, i'd have to write a helper function, and i think that would be worse
10:32:44 PM talktotim86: dont write any helpers
10:33:30 PM talktotim86: can you change tabs to spaces?
10:33:35 PM talktotim86: just to be safe
10:34:14 PM gogogadgetdano: all of em??
10:35:34 PM talktotim86: there should be an option in your text editor
10:35:36 PM talktotim86: if not
10:35:40 PM talktotim86: send it to me
10:35:43 PM talktotim86: and ill do it
10:36:06 PM gogogadgetdano: lemme look
10:36:14 PM talktotim86: another way around that may be changing all comments to /*
10:36:27 PM talktotim86: i think that comments are what fucks up
10:36:48 PM gogogadgetdano: i'll do that
10:37:24 PM gogogadgetdano: but what's the command called, the tabs to spaces thing
10:38:37 PM talktotim86: yeah
10:38:55 PM talktotim86: it should be in a place where you can change you tabs size
10:39:27 PM gogogadgetdano: k
10:39:33 PM talktotim86: it would be such a bummer to have wasted so much time on this and have it shit on our faces like that
10:41:25 PM gogogadgetdano: ok, i just changed all the comments
10:41:33 PM gogogadgetdano: of which there were like, 6 total
10:41:37 PM talktotim86: ha
10:41:45 PM talktotim86: put some more in if you want
10:42:04 PM talktotim86: even if they are trivial
10:42:22 PM gogogadgetdano: i'm going to now
10:42:24 PM gogogadgetdano: since its done
10:42:29 PM gogogadgetdano: the birthday thing worked
10:42:33 PM talktotim86: awesome
10:42:34 PM gogogadgetdano: i redated and stuff
10:42:52 PM gogogadgetdano: and retrieved
10:42:53 PM talktotim86: did you try stuff on empty lists
10:42:55 PM talktotim86: and what not
10:43:01 PM talktotim86: and on one item things
10:46:00 PM gogogadgetdano: right
10:50:08 PM gogogadgetdano: oo
10:50:09 PM gogogadgetdano: bus error
10:50:26 PM talktotim86: uh oh
10:50:39 PM gogogadgetdano: redating an array with only one item
10:50:49 PM gogogadgetdano: list*
10:52:11 PM talktotim86: hrm...
10:55:05 PM talktotim86: i have an opinion on animal collective

11:00:39 PM talktotim86: this show is gonna be incredible
11:01:10 PM gogogadgetdano: yeeeeah
11:09:15 PM gogogadgetdano: ok, it totally has to do with inserting into the list, when the list has only 1 element
11:09:21 PM gogogadgetdano: i've pinpointed where the bus error is coming from
11:12:25 PM gogogadgetdano: oh yea
11:12:39 PM gogogadgetdano: u there??????
11:12:42 PM talktotim86: yeah
11:12:47 PM gogogadgetdano: i hate this invisible shit
11:12:52 PM talktotim86: ha
11:13:21 PM gogogadgetdano: i think we need to put in a condition to handle when the list only has 1 element
11:13:48 PM gogogadgetdano: because list's insert function can't be performed on a list of 1 node.
11:15:09 PM talktotim86: sounds good
11:32:24 PM gogogadgetdano: fixed
11:32:32 PM talktotim86: awe3some
11:32:34 PM gogogadgetdano: now, for size 0
11:38:27 PM gogogadgetdano: mwaghagh!
11:38:46 PM gogogadgetdano: we copied over an assert call from retrieveitem to retrievedate but never changed the message!
11:39:02 PM talktotim86: ha

Smegma is common to all mammals, male and female.
