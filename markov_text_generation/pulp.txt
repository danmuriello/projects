A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles.

It's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed,

there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching

on bacon and eating eggs.

 

Two of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The

Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and, like

his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're going

out of style.

 

It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or how

old she is; everything she does contradicts something she did.

The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is to be said

in a rapid-pace "HIS GIRL FRIDAY" fashion.

 

YOUNG MAN

No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm

through doin' that shit.

 

YOUNG WOMAN

You always say that, the same thing

every time: never again, I'm

through, too dangerous.

 

YOUNG MAN

I know that's what I always say.

I'm always right too, but --

 

YOUNG WOMAN

-- but you forget about it in a day

or two --

 

YOUNG MAN

-- yeah, well, the days of me

forgittin' are over, and the days

of me rememberin' have just begun.

 

YOUNG WOMAN

When you go on like this, you know

what you sound like?

 

YOUNG MAN

I sound like a sensible fucking

man, is what I sound like.

 

YOUNG WOMAN

You sound like a duck.

(imitates a duck)

Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack,

quack, quack...

 

YOUNG MAN

Well take heart, 'cause you're

never gonna hafta hear it again.

Because since I'm never gonna do it

again, you're never gonna hafta

hear me quack about how I'm never

gonna do it again.

 

YOUNG WOMAN

After tonight.

 

The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in

there, back and forth.

 

YOUNG MAN

(with a smile)

Correct. I got all tonight to

quack.

 

A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee.

 

WAITRESS

Can I get anybody anymore coffee?

 

YOUNG WOMAN

Oh yes, thank you.

 

The Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man

lights up another cigarette.
