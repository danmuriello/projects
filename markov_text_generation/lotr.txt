FADE IN ON: 
 
EXT. THE MISTY MOUNTAINS - DAY 
 
HIGH WIDE AERIAL ON: CAMERA flies over the snow-covered peaks of 
the Misty Mountains. As the tranquillity of the scene sinks in, 
voices disrupt the peacefulness. 
 
   GANDALF (O.S.) 
 You cannot pass! 
 
   FRODO (O.S.) 
 Gandalf! 
 
ON THE SOUNDTRACK: A faint crash sounds over the landscape. 
 
   GANDALF (O.S.) 
 I am the servant of the Secret Fire, 
 wielder of the Flame of Anor!  
 
PAN CLOSER TO THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS.  
 
   GANDALF (O.S.)(CONT’D) 
 Go back to the Shadow. The dark fire 
 will not avail you, flame of Udûn!  
 
TRACK THROUGH THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN TO: 
 
INT. BRIDGE OF KHAZAD-DÛM, MORIA - DAY 
 
WIDE ON: The BALROG slashes at GANDALF with its SWORD OF FLAME 
...GANDALF blocks with GLAMDRING ... a ringing clash and the 
BALROG’S SWORD SHATTERS into MOLTEN FRAGMENTS! 
 
     GANDALF (CONT’D) 
   (booming) 
  You shall not pass!! 
 
The BALROG places one foot onto the bridge. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
2. 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
GANDALF CRIES ALOUD as he summons his LAST RESERVES OF 
STRENGTH!! 
 
He thumps the bridge with his staff...a blinding sheet of white 
flame springs up...the staff shatters...the bridge breaks... 
right at the BALROG’S feet.  
 
The stone bridge drops away into the GULF...from under the 
BALROG. For a moment, the great BEAST remains poised in the air 
...then it plunges down: 
 
SLOW MOTION: RELIEF floods FRODO’S face...GANDALF remains 
trembling on the lip of the broken bridge. 
 
SLOW MOTION: As the BALROG falls, he lashes out with his whip of 
fire... 
 
SLOW MOTION: The thongs of the whip lash and curl around 
GANDALF’S knees, dragging him over the brink! GANDALF just 
manages to hang on by his fingertips. 
 
     FRODO 
   (screaming) 
  Gandalf! 
 
     GANDALF 
   (fierce) 
  Fly, you fools! 
 
     FRODO 
  No! 
 
CLOSE ON: GANDALF lets go his grip and falls away...following  
the BALROG into the BOTTOMLESS ABYSS! 
 
   FRODO (O.S.) (CONT’D) 
 Gandalf! 
 
TRACK AT HIGH SPEED WITH GANDALF AS HE PLUMMETS...THE BALROG 
SMOKES FROM BELOW... 
 
ANGLE ON: GANDALF snatches GLAMDRING as he plummets head-first 
behind the BALROG. 
 
GANDALF alights on the BALROG’S NECK and stabs GLAMDRING deep 
into it...the BALROG swipes at GANDALF loosening GANDALF’S grip. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
3. 
 
CONTINUED: (2) 
 
The BALROG swings at GANDALF several times before snatching 
GANDALF in his GRASP...another bounce off the close walls and 
GANDALF falls freely again. 
 
 
GANDALF grabs ahold of the demon’s horn as they continue their 
never-ending plunge...The BALROG bounces off the walls as  
GANDALF prepares to drive GLAMDRING into its head. 
 
INT. UNDERGROUND CAVERN - DAY 
 
WIDE ON: AT THE UTTERMOST FOUNDATIONS BENEATH THE DEEPEST 
DELVINGS OF THE DWARVES, GANDALF and the BALROG emerge like a 
small ball of fire high above an enormous body of water in a 
cavern without measure. 
 
CLOSE ON: GANDALF’S EYES WIDEN as they crash into the water 
below. 
 
     CUT TO: 
 
EXT. EMYN MUIL - DAY 
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO awakens as if from a nightmare. 
 
   FRODO 
  (calling out) 
 Gandalf! 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO props himself up, hyperventilating. SAM sits up 
behind him. 
 
   SAM 
 What is it, Mr. Frodo? 
 
   FRODO 
 Nothing.  
 
FRODO lies back down. 
 
   FRODO (CONT’D) 
 Just a dream. 
  
4. 
 
EXT. EMYN MUIL - LATER 
 
WIDE ON: FOG lays heavy over the ROCKY LANDSCAPE of EMYN MUIL. 
 
SUPER: THE TWO TOWERS 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM climb down a rock face toward the mist- 
covered ground.  
 
   SAM 
 Can you see the bottom? 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO looks down into the mist. 
 
   FRODO 
 No! Don’t look down, Sam! Just keep  
 going! 
 
CLOSE ON: SAM clings to the ROPE and nods. He slowly continues. 
 
ANGLE ON: The ROPE is tied securely around a rock at the top of 
the face. 
 
ANGLE ON: SAM takes a step and loses his footing...A SMALL BOX 
tumbles out of his pocket! He desperately reaches for it. 
 
   SAM 
 Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo! 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO looks up...THE BOX bounces down the rock... 
FRODO deftly catches it.  
 
SUDDENLY, HE LOSES HIS FOOTING AND PLUNGES INTO THE MIST BELOW! 
 
   SAM 
 Mr. Frodo! 
 
After only a few feet, FRODO lands softly on the ground.  
Stunned, he looks about for a moment, and then up to SAM. 
 
   FRODO 
 I think I’ve found the bottom. 
 
SAM quickly climbs downward and walks away from the rope. 
 
   SAM 
 Bogs and rope, and goodness knows  
 what. It ain’t natural, none of it. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
5. 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
FRODO studies the SMALL BOX. 
 
   FRODO 
 What’s in this? 
 
   SAM 
 Nothing. Just a bit of seasoning.  
 I thought maybe if we was having a  
 roast chicken one night or something. 
 
CLOSE ON: SAM looks at FRODO with the greatest of honesty... 
FRODO looks at SAM incredulously. 
 
   FRODO 
 Roast chicken?! 
 
SAM shrugs. 
 
   SAM 
 You never know. 
 
FRODO laughs and shakes his head. 
 
   FRODO 
 Sam. My dear Sam. 
 
CLOSE ON: Carefully, FRODO opens the lid to look inside. The  
BOX is filled to the brim with SEASONING. 
 
   SAM 
 It’s very special, that. It’s the best  
 salt in all the Shire. 
 
   FRODO 
 It is special. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO looks at SAM nostalgically.  
 
   FRODO (CONT’D) 
 It’s a little bit of home. 
 
FRODO hands the box back to SAM and walks over to the rope still 
tied at the top of the cliff. He gazes upward. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
6. 
 
CONTINUED: (2) 
 
   FRODO (CONT’D) 
 We can’t leave this here for someone  
 to follow us down. 
 
   SAM 
 Who’s gonna to follow us down here,  
 Mr. Frodo? 
 
FRODO looks at the rope, worried...SAM looks at it longingly. 
 
   SAM (CONT’D) 
 It’s a shame, really. Lady Galadriel  
 gave me that. Real Elvish rope. 
 
SAM puts the box of seasoning in his pocket and walks over to 
the rock face. 
 
   SAM (CONT’D) 
 Well, there’s nothing for it. It’s one  
 of my knots. Won’t come free in a hurry. 
 
SAM tugs on the rope - hard. 
 
ANGLE ON: The ELVISH ROPE unties itself and plummets. 
 
ANGLE ON: The ROPE lands at SAM’S FEET...SAM stands speechless  
for a moment, and then he looks at FRODO who shrugs. 
 
   FRODO 
 Real Elvish rope. 
 
SAM looks briefly at the bit he is still holding, and then at 
the summit far above. 
 
EXT. EMYN MUIL - DAY 
 
WIDE ON: FRODO and SAM climb over the rocky terrain to reach the 
summit of another part of EMYN MUIL.  
 
ANGLE ON: They look into the distance at the MORDOR. MOUNT  
DOOM belches fire and smoke. 
 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
7. 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
   SAM  
 Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth  
 we don’t want to see any closer. And the 
 one place we’re trying to get to. It’s 
  just where we can’t get.  
 
CLOSE ON: SAM turns to FRODO, worried. 
 
   SAM (CONT’D) 
 Let’s face it, Mr. Frodo, we’re lost.  
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO looks at SAM, scared. 
 
   SAM (CONT’D) 
 I don’t think Gandalf meant for us to 
 come this way. 
 
   FRODO 
 He didn’t mean for a lot of things 
 to happen, Sam ... but they did.  
 
Suddenly, FRODO gasps.  
 
INSERT IMAGE: From deep within Mordor the BLAZING EYE OF  
SAURON looks directly upon him from high atop THE TOWER OF 
BARAD-DÛR.  
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO shudders and turns away from the sight. He sits, 
panting.  
 
ANGLE ON: SAM turns to him. 
 
   SAM 
 Mr. Frodo?  
 
FRODO continues panting, unable to respond. 
 
   SAM (CONT’D) 
 It’s the Ring, isn’t it? 
 
   FRODO 
 It’s getting heavier.  
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO clutches the RING on his chest.  
 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
8. 
 
CONTINUED: (2) 
 
ANGLE ON: SAM sits behind him and begins to go through his pack. 
FRODO fumbles for his water bottle and takes a deep gulp. 
 
   FRODO (CONT’D) 
 What food have we got left? 
 
   SAM 
 Let me see.  
 
CLOSE ON: He takes a LEAF-WRAPPED BIT OF ELVEN BREAD from his 
pack. 
  
   SAM (CONT’D) 
 Oh yes, lovely. Lembas bread. And look!  
 
He digs deeper into his pack and pulls out: 
 
   SAM (CONT’D) 
 More Lembas bread.  
 
He breaks off a piece and tosses it to FRODO, and then eats a 
piece himself. 
 
   SAM (CONT’D) 
 I don't usually hold with foreign food, 
 but this Elvish stuff, it’s not bad. 
 
   FRODO 
  (smiling) 
 Nothing ever dampens your spirits,  
 does it, Sam? 
 
SAM smiles back, glances at his bread, as if considering another 
bite, and then looks ominously off into the distance. His 
expression drops. 
 
   SAM 
 Those rain clouds might.  
 
EXT. EMYN MUIL - NIGHT 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM sit huddled together wrapped in their 
cloaks...RAIN beats mercilessly down upon them...neither one 
sleeps. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
9. 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
HIGH WIDE ON: The HOBBITS shivering at the base of the rocks... 
HARSH BREATHING SOUNDS...A HAND rests on the edge of the cliff. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO suddenly looks up. 
 
LOW ANGLE ON: The side of the rock face...nothing is seen on  
its peak. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO shakes his head and huddles back down into his 
cloak. 
 
     CUT TO: 
 
EXT. EMYN MUIL - DAY 
 
ANGLES ON: FRODO and SAM climb over the rocks...walk along a  
path...scale the side of a rock face...walk along a summit... 
 
   SAM 
 This looks strangely familiar. 
 
   FRODO 
  (exasperated)  
 It’s because we’ve been here before. 
 We’re going in circles.  
 
SAM walks to an overlook. 
 
   SAM 
 What's that horrid stink? I warrant 
 there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you 
 smell it? 
 
   FRODO 
 Yes. I can smell it.  
 
FRODO walks over to join SAM at the overlook. 
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO looks to SAM ominously. 
 
   FRODO (CONT’D) 
  (whispers) 
 We’re not alone. 
 
     CUT TO: 
 
10. 
 
EXT. EMYN MUIL - NIGHT 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM sleep.  
 
HIGH WIDE: A dark, spidery shape appears on top of the cliff  
and makes its way down to the slumbering HOBBITS.  
 
ANGLE ON: The emaciated creature is dressed only in a tattered 
loincloth, and appears mostly human in appearance. Its frame is 
quite thin, but its hands, feet, and eyes are oversized. What 
hair remains is thin and falls where it may about its shoulders. 
It descends the rock face upside down like an insect. This is 
GOLLUM. He speaks in an ancient, gravely voice. 
 
   GOLLUM 
 The thieves. The thieves. The filthy 
 little thieves. Where is it?  
 
CRANE BEHIND GOLLUM as he climbs down. 
 
   GOLLUM (CONT’D) 
 Where is it? They stole it from us. 
 My precious. Curse them, we hates them! 
 It’s ours, it is, and we wants it!  
 
GOLLUM reaches his hand out to snatch his prize. 
 
SUDDENLY, the HOBBITS spring and snatch GOLLUM off the side of 
the rock. Amidst the struggle, GOLLUM wriggles loose and throws 
them both away from him.  
 
As FRODO falls back, the RING comes out of his shirt.  
 
GOLLUM recovers and sees the RING. He leaps straight for it. 
GOLLUM desperately tries to get his hands on his  
precious while FRODO struggles to prevent this. 
 
SAM recovers and grabs GOLLUM by the ankle, dragging him  
away from FRODO...GOLLUM reels back and hits SAM in the face, 
knocking him away.  
 
He pounces back on FRODO and reaches for the RING...FRODO  
grabs Gollum’s hand, and struggles against his considerable 
strength.  
 
CLOSE ON: GOLLUM’S cheeks puff with exertion as he struggles  
with FRODO, his enormous eyes fixed on the RING.  
 
      (CONTINUED) 
11. 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
ANGLE ON: SAM comes up from behind GOLLUM again, and lifts  
him off of FRODO...GOLLUM grasps FRODO, throwing him off to  
one side as SAM swings GOLLUM around.  
 
GOLLUM leaps from Sam’s grasp onto the rock wall beside them, 
and then back on top of FRODO. 
 
SAM pulls GOLLUM off again, and GOLLUM turns on him...he  
fiercely bits SAM on the neck. SAM struggles against him,  
but GOLLUM reels around, wraps his legs around SAM and tries to 
choke him! 
 
SAM falls to the ground atop GOLLUM, but GOLLUM continues to 
have the upper hand. 
 
SUDDENLY, FRODO grabs GOLLUM by the hair, and holds STING to  
his neck.  
 
CLOSE ON: GOLLUM’S eyes go wide, and he freezes. He maintains a 
hold on SAM. 
 
   FRODO 
  (menacingly) 
 This is Sting. You’ve seen it before, 
 haven’t you ... Gollum?  
 
ANGLE ON: SAM tries to break GOLLUM’S grip, unsuccessfully. 
 
   FRODO (CONT’D) 
 Release him or I’ll cut your throat!  
 
ANGLE ON: Slowly, GOLLUM loosens his grip on SAM...and then 
WAILS.  
 
     CUT TO: 
 
EXT. EMYN MUIL - DAY 
 
WIDE ON: Gollum’s wail ECHOES across the vast, rocky landscape  
of EMYN MUIL. 
 
EXT. EMYN MUIL - DAY 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM walks through EMYN MUIL...SAM tugs on 
the rope and GOLLUM stumbles behind them. GOLLUM continues to  
SCREAM and WAIL. 
 
      (CONTINUED)
12. 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
   GOLLUM 
 It burns! It burns us! It freezes! 
 Nasty Elves twisted it. Take it off 
 us! 
 
SAM continues dragging GOLLUM, willing or not, across the rocks. 
 
   SAM 
 Quiet, you!  
 
GOLLUM stops again.  
 
SAM tugs fiercely at the rope to try and get him to come along, 
but GOLLUM wails again, unmoving. SAM turns to FRODO in dismay. 
 
   SAM (CONT’D) 
 It’s hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor’s 
 going to hear this racket. Let’s just 
 tie him up and leave him.  
 
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM stops crying at once and turns to the HOBBITS 
wide-eyed and pleading. 
 
   GOLLUM 
 No! That would kill us! Kill us! 
 
   SAM 
 It’s no more than you deserve! 
 
GOLLUM wails again and COLLAPSES onto the ground, writhing. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO looks down to GOLLUM. 
 
   FRODO 
 Maybe he does deserve to die. But now 
 that I see him, I do pity him. 
 
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM suddenly stops and turns to FRODO, smiling. 
 
   GOLLUM 
  (begging)  
 We be nice to them if they be nice 
 to us. Take it off us.  
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM look at GOLLUM warily. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
13. 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
   GOLLUM (CONT’D) 
 We swears to do what you wants. We 
 swears. 
 
   FRODO 
 There’s no promise you can make that I 
 can trust. 
 
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM scrambles up and bows to FRODO desperately. 
 
   GOLLUM 
  (smiling) 
 We swears to serve the master of the 
 precious. We will swear on the...on 
 the precious.  
  (coughing) 
 Gollum. Gollum.  
 
   FRODO 
 The Ring is treacherous. It will hold 
 you to your word. 
 
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM crawls over to FRODO. 
 
   GOLLUM 
 Yes...on the precious. On the precious. 
 
   SAM 
 I don’t believe you!  
 
ANGLE ON: SAM lunges at GOLLUM...GOLLUM jumps away, frightened, 
and climbs onto a boulder. 
 
   SAM (CONT’D) 
 Get down! I said, down!  
 
SAM jerks strongly at the rope. GOLLUM crashes to the ground, 
choking. 
 
   FRODO 
 Sam! 
 
   SAM 
 He’s trying to trick us! If we let 
 him go he’ll throttle us in our 
 sleep. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
14. 
 
CONTINUED: (2) 
 
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM lies panting and holding his throat. He backs 
away, frightened, as FRODO approaches him. 
 
   FRODO 
 You know the way to Mordor? 
 
   GOLLUM 
  (warily) 
 Yes. 
 
   FRODO 
 You’ve been there before? 
 
   GOLLUM 
 Yes. 
 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO reaches out and removes the rope from GOLLUM’S 
neck. GOLLUM is surprised and relieved.  
 
CLOSE ON: SAM is displeased. 
 
   FRODO 
 You will lead us to the Black Gate. 
 
     CUT TO: 
 
EXT. EMYN MUIL - DAY 
 
TRACK WITH: GOLLUM scrambles quickly through the rocky crags, 
looking back to make sure the HOBBITS are behind him.  
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM struggle to keep his pace.  
 
   SMÉAGOL 
 To the Gate, to the Gate! To the Gate,  
 the master says. Yes! 
 
CLOSE ON: GOLLUM sports an EVIL FACE. 
 
   GOLLUM 
 No! We won’t go back. Not there.  
 Not to him. They can’t make us. 
  (coughing) 
 Gollum! Gollum! 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
15. 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
He scrambles on further and stops atop a rock. His FACE turns 
suddenly SOFT. 
 
   SMÉAGOL 
  (pleading) 
 But we swore to serve the master of  
 the precious. 
 
   GOLLUM 
 No. Ashes and dust and thirst there  
 is, and pits, pits, pits.  
 
ANGLE ON: SAM and FRODO run up behind him, listening. 
 
   GOLLUM (CONT’D) 
 And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.  
 And always the Great Eye watching,  
 watching. 
 
He hides in face in his hands at the horror of the thought. 
 
Suddenly, he looks back to see SAM and FRODO. He lets out a 
frightening growl and runs off down the path.  
 
SAM starts forward. 
 
GOLLUM leaps down a rock wall and scurries away from the 
HOBBITS.  
 
   SAM 
 Hey! Come back now! Come back! 
 
SAM and FRODO try to follow, but he has escaped them. 
 
   SAM (CONT’D) 
 There! What did I tell you? He’s run  
 off, the old villain. So much for his  
 promises. 
 
GOLLUM pops up behind a nearby rock. 
 
   GOLLUM 
 This way, Hobbits. Follow me! 
 
FRODO quickly runs after him. SAM, with a scowl, concedes to 
follow as well. 
 
     CUT TO: 
   
16. 
 
EXT. PLAINS OF ROHAN - DAY 
 
CRANE DOWN TO: A BAND OF URUK-HAI runs across ROHAN. MERRY and 
PIPPIN, ride on the backs of two URUK-HAI, their hands bound 
around the URUK-HAIS’ necks.  
 
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN tries to call to MERRY, who is unconscious  
with a gash on his brow. 
 
   PIPPIN 
 Merry! Merry!  
 
MERRY does not respond.  
 
ANGLE ON: SUDDENLY, the leading URUK-HAI, MAÚHUR, signals a  
stop. He sniffs the air. 
 
ANGLE ON: Several Orcs from the North emerge from behind some 
rocks. They are led by a short, crook-legged Orc, very broad 
with long arms that hang almost to the ground called GRISHNÁKH. 
 
   GRISHNÁKH 
 You’re late. Our master grows impatient.  
 He wants the Shire-rats now. 
 
ANGLE ON: UGLÚK looks at MAÚHUR amused. 
 
   UGLÚK 
 I don’t take orders from Orc-maggots. 
 
ANGLE ON: GRISHNÁKH’S face falls.  
 
   UGLÚK (CONT’D) 
 Saruman will have his prize. We will  
 deliver them. 
 
UGLÚK turns away from the Northern Orcs. 
 
ANGLE ON: GRISHNÁKH mocks him as he walks away, but they make  
no move on the URUK-HAI. 
 
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN tries again to rouse MERRY. 
 
   PIPPIN 
 Merry! Merry? Wake up. 
 
ANGLE ON: MERRY’S head lolls around, unresponsive. PIPPIN looks 
over to an Orc drinking his draught.  
 
      (CONTINUED) 
17. 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
   PIPPIN (CONT’D) 
 My friend is sick. 
 
ANGLE ON: An URUK-HAI turns to PIPPIN and growls. 
 
   PIPPIN (CONT’D) 
 He needs water. Please! 
 
ANGLE ON: UGLÚK makes his way through the ranks to the  
prisoners. 
 
   UGLÚK 
 Sick, is he? Give him some medicine,  
 boys! 
 
The ORCS laugh and dump their ORC-DRAUGHT down MERRY’S throat. 
MERRY chokes on the foul stuff. 
 
   PIPPIN 
 Stop it! 
 
   UGLÚK 
 Can’t take his draught! 
 
The Orcs laugh again as MERRY chokes on the draught.  
 
   PIPPIN 
 Leave him alone! 
 
   UGLÚK 
 Why? 
 
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN looks at UGLÚK, afraid to respond. 
   
   UGLÚK (CONT’D) 
 You want some?  
 
PIPPIN doesn’t respond. 
 
   UGLÚK (CONT’D) 
 Then keep your mouth shut. 
 
UGLÚK turns and walks away.

 Merry.

   MERRY 
 Hello, Pip. 
 
   PIPPIN 
 You’re hurt. 
 
   MERRY 
  (smiling uneasily) 
 I’m fine. It was just an act. 
 
   PIPPIN 
  (disbelieving) 
 An act? 
 
   MERRY 
 See? I fooled you too. 
 
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN smiles uneasily. 
 
   MERRY (CONT’D) 
 Don’t worry about me, Pippin. 
 
ANGLE ON: MAÚHUR sniffs the air again. UGLÚK appears behind  
him. 
 
   UGLÚK 
 What is it? What do you smell? 
 
   MAÚHUR 
 Man-flesh. 
 
   UGLÚK 
 They've picked up our trail.  
 
   PIPPIN 
  (quietly to himself)  
 Aragorn! 
 
   UGLÚK 
  (loudly, to the company) 
 Let's move!

The URUK-HAI break into a run. The NORTHERN ORCS follow.  
 
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN struggles to remove his ELVEN BROOCH from his 
LÓRIEN cloak with his teeth. Once he has it, he spits it onto 
the ground.  
 
CLOSE ON: The brooch lands in the grass. The URUK-HAI trample 
it, but it remains unbroken and visible. 
 
     CUT TO: 
 
EXT. WESTERN EMYN MUIL - DAY 
 
ARAGORN lies on the ground with his eyes closed and ear pressed 
to the ground, listening. Suddenly, he opens his eyes. 
 
   ARAGORN 
  (softly)

 Come on, Gimli!

ground. LEGOLAS stops and turns to him.

 Come, Gimli! We are gaining on them!

 I am wasted on cross-country. We  
 dwarves are natural sprinters. Very 
 dangerous over short distances. 
 
ANGLE ON: The HUNTERS come over a hill and pause as they gaze 
across the open fields of ROHAN.

 Your son is badly wounded, my lord.

 He was ambushed by Orcs.  
 
ANGLE ON: THÉODEN makes no response. He stares off into the 
distance. 
 
   ÉOMER (CONT’D) 
 If we don’t defend our country, 
 Saruman will take it by force. 
 
   WORMTONGUE (O.S.) 
 That is a lie.

ANGLE ON: ÉOMER drops one of the ORC HELMETS onto the ground, 
which topples over to reveal the WHITE HAND OF SARUMAN.  
 
ANGLE ON: WORMTONGUE looks at it, as if considering his words.  
Finally, he speaks, but kneels down to THÉODRED, as if speaking 
to the king. 
 
   WORMTONGUE 
 Why do you lay these troubles on an 
 already troubled mind? Can you not 
 see? Your uncle is wearied by your 
 malcontent, your warmongering. 
 
ANGLE ON: ÉOMER looks over to WORMTONGUE, surprised. 
 
   ÉOMER 
 Warmongering?  
 
ÉOMER grabs WORMTONGUE and pins him against a pillar. 
 
   ÉOMER (CONT’D) 
 How long is it since Saruman bought 
 you? What was the promised price, 
 Gríma? When all the Men are dead, you 
 will take your share of the treasure?

 You see much, Éomer, Son of Éomund.  
 Too much.  
 
The thugs punch ÉOMER in the stomach.

 You are banished forthwith from the 
 kingdom of Rohan and all its domains 
 under pain of death. 
 
ANGLE ON: ÉOMER struggles against the MEN. 
 
   ÉOMER 
 You have no authority here. Your  
 orders mean nothing. 
 
One of the MEN punches ÉOMER in the stomach again. 
 
   WORMTONGUE 
  (shaking his head and smiling) 
 This order does not come from me.  
 It comes from the king.

 It’s the trees. 
 
   PIPPIN 
 What? 
 
   MERRY 
 Do you remember the Old Forest, on the

 there was something in the water that 
 made the trees grow tall...and come 
 alive. 
 
   PIPPIN 
 Alive?

 Trees that could whisper, talk to each 
 other, even move.

The ROHIRRIM withdraw their spears. 
 
   ÉOMER (CONT’D) 
 Saruman has poisoned the mind of the 
 king and claimed lordship over these 
 lands. My company are those loyal to 
 Rohan. And for that, we are banished.  
  (quietly to the THREE; accusing) 
 The White Wizard is cunning. He walks 
 here and there, they say, as an old man 
 hooded and cloaked. And everywhere, his 
 spies slip past our nets. 
 
   ARAGORN 
 We are no spies. We track a party of 
 Uruk-Hai westward across the plain. They 
 have taken two of our friends captive. 
 
   ÉOMER 
 The Uruks are destroyed. We slaughtered 
 them during the night. 
 
ANGLE ON: GIMLI springs forward. 
 
   GIMLI 
  (desperately) 
 But there were two Hobbits. Did you 
 see two Hobbits with them? 
 
   ARAGORN 
 They would be small. Only children to 
 your eyes. 
 
   ÉOMER 
  (shaking his head) 
 We left none alive. We piled the 
 carcasses and burned them.  
 
ANGLE ON: Smoke rises from a pile in the distance.  
 
ANGLES ON: ARAGORN looks away, dumbfounded...GIMLI stands in 
shock. 
 
   GIMLI 
 Dead?

   ÉOMER 
  (nodding)  
 I am sorry.  
 
LEGOLAS puts a hand on Gimli’s shoulder in grief.  
 
ANGLE ON: ÉOMER turns and whistles. 
 
   ÉOMER 
 Hasufel! Arod! 
 
Two steeds move to the forefront. ÉOMER lovingly places his  
hand on them. 
 
   ÉOMER 
 May these horses bear you to better 
 fortune than their former masters. 
 Farewell.  
 
ÉOMER puts on his helmet and returns to his horse. 
 
   ÉOMER 
 Look for your friends. But do not trust 
 to hope. It has forsaken these lands.  
  (To the RIDERS)  
 We ride north! 
 
WIDE ON: The ROHIRRIM quickly ride off and disappear to the 
North. 
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN looks toward the smoldering pile. 
 
EXT. PLAINS OF ROHAN - DAY 
 
WIDE ON: ARAGORN on HASUFEL, and GIMLI riding behind LEGOLAS  
on AROD, they ride across the Plains toward the edge of the 
FANGORN FOREST, where the pile of dead Orcs smolders. 
 
EXT. BORDERS OF FANGORN - DAY 
 
ANGLE ON: THE THREE HUNTERS halt their steeds beside the pile 
and dismount. They look upon the pile with dismay. 
 
      (CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: 
 
LATER... 
 
GIMLI half-heartedly shifts through the smoldering ORCS with his 
axe. He reaches down to retrieve one of the HOBBITS’ sheathes. 
He turns mournfully to ARAGORN and LEGOLAS. 
 
   GIMLI 
 It’s one of their wee belts. 
 
ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS bows his head and closes his eyes. 
 
   LEGOLAS 
  (in ELVISH) 
 Hiro hyn hîdh ab 'wanath. 
 
 May they find peace in death. 
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN kicks a helmet. He screams a cry of anguished 
defeat and falls to his knees, hanging his head low. He sits in 
despair. 
 
   GIMLI 
 We failed them. 
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns his head. Something on the ground 
suddenly catches his attention. A glimmer of hope flickers 
across his visage as he notes some marks on the ground. He moves 
towards them, and touches the spots with his hands. 
 
   ARAGORN 
 A Hobbit lay here. And the other. 
 
He sits back to ponder the meaning of these marks. 
 
INTERCUT WITH: PIPPIN screams as the HORSE rears over him. He 
rolls out of the way as it CRASHES DOWN. 
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN’S eyes shift to a new set of markings off to 
one side. 
 
   ARAGORN (CONT’D) 
 They crawled.  
 
INTERCUT WITH: PIPPIN crawls across the raging battlefield. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
41. 
 
CONTINUED: (2) 
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN tracks the HOBBITS with LEGOLAS and GIMLI 
closely following his progress. He points out the marks. 
 
   ARAGORN (CONT’D) 
 Their hands were bound. 
 
INTERCUT WITH: PIPPIN reaches a fallen blade. He rubs his bonds 
furiously against its sharp edge. 
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN comes upon a short length of rope buried in  
the trampled grass. 
 
   ARAGORN (CONT’D) 
 Their bonds were cut.  
 
He continues tracking across the grass. 
 
INTERCUT WITH: PIPPIN frantically releases MERRY from his bonds, 
and pulls him to his feet. They begin to make their way to 
safety outside the ring of battle. 
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN continues to follow their progress from the 
history they left in the dirt and grass. 
 
INTERCUT WITH: MERRY and PIPPIN narrowly avoid horse, spear, and 
falling ORC to make their way to safety. 
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN points out their tracks in the ground. 
 
   ARAGORN (CONT’D) 
 They ran over here.  
 
As he follows the prints, he notes another set along side them. 
 
   ARAGORN (CONT’D) 
 They were followed. 
 
INTERCUT WITH: As they flee, GRISHNÁKH, wounded on the ground, 
grabs PIPPIN by his belt and clings on. 
 
   MERRY 
 The belt!  
 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
42. 
 
CONTINUED: (4) 
 
PIPPIN unbuckles his belt, leaving it with GRISHNÁKH.  
GRISHNÁKH throws it onto the ground and crawls after them. The 
HOBBITS continue running at their top speed away across the 
plain. 
 
   MERRY (CONT’D) 
 Run!  
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN runs after their tracks, imagining them. 
 
   ARAGORN 
 The tracks lead away from the battle...  
 
INTERCUT WITH: MERRY and PIPPIN run right into FANGORN FOREST  
and disappear in the trees. 
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI are running and stop  
short of entering FANGORN. 
 
   ARAGORN (CONT’D) 
 ...into Fangorn Forest.  
 
WIDE ON: The THREE HUNTERS look into the dense and dark forest 
of gnarled trees so close together, it’s as if it is guarding 
against entry. 
 
   GIMLI 
 Fangorn? What madness drove them in there?  
 
ANGLE ON: The THREE HUNTERS continue to look into the forest, 
uncertain as to whether they should enter or not. 
 
PAN INTO THE FOREST AND CROSSFADE TO: 
 
EXT. FANGORN FOREST - NIGHT 
 
WIDE ON: PIPPIN and MERRY charge into the looming forest  
checking behind them as they go.  
 
ANGLE ON: They finally collapse on a bed of leaves and look 
about them.  
 
WIDE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN seem all of a sudden much smaller 
compared to the majesty of the ancient forest. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
43. 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
   PIPPIN 
 Did we lose him? I think we lost him. 
 
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN and MERRY turns in the direction of an 
approaching sound. Their expressions drop. 
 
ANGLE ON: GRISHNÁKH stumbles his way through the underbrush, 
looking for them. He holds his blade before him, ready to 
strike. 
 
   GRISHNÁKH 
  (grumbling) 
 I’m going to rip out your filthy little 
 innards!  
 
ANGLE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN hasten behind a tree. 
 
   GRISHNÁKH (CONT’D) 
 Come here! 
 
ANGLE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN run across the forest, desperate for  
a hiding place. 
 
   MERRY 
 Trees. Climb a tree. 
 
ANGLES ON: MERRY and PIPPIN quickly climb the nearest tree.  
 
ANGLE ON: MERRY climbs to the lowermost branch and looks about 
the forest.  
 
POV: GRISHNÁKH is nowhere in sight. MERRY sighs with relief. 
 
   MERRY (CONT’D) 
 He's gone. 
 
SUDDENLY, MERRY is jerked out of the tree.  
 
ANGLE ON: He falls to the ground in a heap, and GRISHNÁKH looms 
over him, hungrily. MERRY kicks him in the face, but he is 
undeterred. MERRY attempts to back away from his attacker, but 
GRISHNÁKH maintains his superior position. 
 
   PIPPIN 
  (from the tree) 
 Merry!  
 
      (CONTINUED) 
44. 
 
CONTINUED: (2) 
 
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN looks down, helpless. Suddenly, as if reacting 
to Pippin’s yell, TWO YELLOW EYES flicker open on the tree. 
PIPPIN glances over to them, and then back to MERRY.  
 
Realization dawns on him, and he slowly looks back at the EYES. 
The TREE grimaces and then turns its head to looks directly at 
PIPPIN.  
 
Speechless, PIPPIN loses his grip and begins to fall.  
The TREE lifts one of its limbs and catches PIPPIN in its hand 
before he can get very far.  
 
ANGLE ON: GRISHNÁKH raises his blade to pierce MERRY.  
  
   GRISHNÁKH 
 Let’s put a maggot hole in your belly! 
 
The TREE raises a leg high over GRISHNÁKH. 
 
ANGLE ON: MERRY takes his attention from GRISHNÁKH and focuses 
on the TREE.  
 
ANGLE ON: GRISHNÁKH notices MERRY’S expression and looks  
behind him.  
 
HIGH ANGLE ON: The TREE brings its leg down and smashes  
GRISHNÁKH into the ground. 
 
   PIPPIN 
 Run, Merry! 
 
ANGLE ON: MERRY runs, but is quickly overtaken by the TREE who 
takes a mighty step and scoops MERRY up into his other hand.  
 
ANGLE ON: The TREE examines the struggling HOBBITS as he 
continues walking through the forest. 
 
   THE TREE 
 Little Orcs. Burárum... 
 
PIPPIN stops struggling and looks at MERRY, wide-eyed. 
 
   PIPPIN 
 It’s talking, Merry. The tree is talking. 
 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
45. 
 
CONTINUED: (3) 
 
   THE TREE 
  (angrily) 
 Tree? I am no tree! I am an Ent.  
 
ANGLE ON: Recognition dawns on MERRY’S face, and he smiles in 
wonder and delight. 
 
   MERRY 
 A tree-herder. A shepherd of the forest. 
 
   PIPPIN 
 Don’t talk to it, Merry. Don’t  
 encourage it! 
 
   TREEBEARD 
 TREEBEARD, some call me. 
 
   PIPPIN 
 And whose side are you on? 
 
   TREEBEARD 
 Side? I am on nobody’s side because 
 nobody’s on my side, little Orc. 
 Nobody cares for the woods anymore. 
 
   MERRY 
 We’re not Orcs! We’re Hobbits! 
 
   TREEBEARD 
 Hobbits? Never heard of a Hobbit 
 before. Sounds like Orc mischief to me!  
 
He squeezes the HOBBITS in rage...MERRY and PIPPIN squirm in  
pain. 
 
   TREEBEARD (CONT’D) 
  (angrily) 
 They come with fire. They come with 
 axes. Gnawing, biting, breaking, 
 hacking, burning! Destroyers and 
 usurpers! Curse them!  
 
   MERRY 
 No! You don’t understand. We’re 
 Hobbits! Halflings! Shire-folk!  
 
      (CONTINUED) 
46. 
 
CONTINUED: (4) 
 
They continue struggling in TREEBEARD’S firm grip. 
 
   TREEBEARD 
 Maybe you are and maybe you aren’t. The 
 White Wizard will know. 
 
   PIPPIN 
  (worried) 
 The White Wizard? 
 
   MERRY 
  (quietly) 
 Saruman. 
 
TREEBEARD drops them at the feet of a WIZARD dressed in  
gleaming white with long, white hair. MERRY and PIPPIN slowly 
look up to the WIZARD.

EXT. EMYN MUIL - DAY 
 
GOLLUM scrambles upward through a narrow pass, with FRODO and  
SAM following close behind. He leaps up to a higher point as  
the HOBBITS trail. 
 
   GOLLUM 
 See? See? We have led you out. Hurry, 
 Hobbitses. Hurry!  
 
FRODO and SAM catch up to GOLLUM. He climbs atop a rock.  
 
   GOLLUM (CONT’D) 
 Very lucky we find you. 
 
WIDE ON: They stand at the edge of EMYN MUIL overlooking the  
next part of their journey with MORDOR in the distance. FRODO 
walks past, but SAM pauses to give GOLLUM an evil look. GOLLUM 
cringes. 
 
   GOLLUM (CONT’D) 
 Nice Hobbit.  
 
He leaps after FRODO, putting a wide berth between him and SAM. 
 
      CUT TO: 
 
47. 
 
EXT. THE DEAD MARSHES - TWILIGHT 
 
ANGLE ON: Sam’s foot slips in a puddle of muck...he starts 
backward to get a view of where they’re going. 
 
   SAM 
 It’s a bog. He’s led us into a swamp. 
 
   GOLLUM 
 A swamp, yes, yes. Come, master. We 
 will take you on safe paths through 
 the mist.  
 
WIDE ON: GOLLUM starts making his way across an invisible path 
across the wetlands. He looks back to the HOBBITS. 
 
   GOLLUM 
  (gesturing) 
 Come, Hobbits, come. We go quickly.  
 
FRODO and SAM follow him. 
 
EXT. AERIAL OF THE DEAD MARSHES - DAY 
 
AERIAL: The DEAD MARSHES stretch for miles and miles as far as  
the eye can see...FRODO, SAM, and GOLLUM appear AS TINY AS  
SPECKS slowly crossing it. 
 
   GOLLUM (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
 I found it, I did. The way through the 
 marshes. Orcs don't use it. Orcs don't 
 know it. They go around for miles and 
 miles. Come quickly. Soft and quick as 
 shadows we must be. 
 
EXT. THE DEAD MARSHES - DAY 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO, SAM and GOLLUM rest from the day’s journey. 
 
   SAM 
 I hate this place. It’s too quiet. 
 There’s been no sight or sound of 
 a bird for two days. 
 
   GOLLUM 
 No, no birdses to eat. No crunchable 
 birdses.  
 
      (CONTINUED) 
48. 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
SAM locates some LEMBAS BREAD in his pack and hands some to 
FRODO, before getting some for himself. GOLLUM pounds the ground 
in frustration. 
 
   GOLLUM (CONT’D) 
 We are famished! Yes! Famished we are,  
 precious! 
 
Suddenly, GOLLUM sees something on the ground. His eyes dart 
around following it, before his hands move like lightning to 
snatch up- 
 
-a worm. He looks at it suspiciously, shakes it a little, and 
then slurps it down with a grimace.  
 
CLOSE ON: SAM grimaces as well and opts out of finishing his  
bit of LAMBAS BREAD. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO breaks a piece off of his bread and tosses it to 
GOLLUM. 
 
   FRODO 
 Here. 
 
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM snaps around to look at it. 
 
   GOLLUM 
 What does it eats? 
 
He runs over to the piece on the ground and circles it like a 
hungry animal. 
 
   GOLLUM (CONT’D) 
 Is it tasty? 
 
He picks it up and tosses it into his mouth. Almost immediately, 
he dramatically chokes on it and spits it out.  
 
CLOSE ON: SAM rolls his eyes and sighs.  
 
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM hacks and coughs. 
 
   GOLLUM (CONT’D) 
 It tries to chokes us! We can’t eats  
 Hobbit food! We must starve!

GOLLUM bawls and falls onto his back, whining. 
 
   SAM 
 Well, starve, then. And good riddance! 
 
GOLLUM crawls toward SAM. 
 
   GOLLUM 
 Oh, cruel Hobbit. It does not care if  
 we be hungry. Does not care if we  
 should die.  
 
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM turns to FRODO, his eyes growing wide and 
innocent.  
 
   GOLLUM (CONT’D) 
 Not like master. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO ignores GOLLUM’S words. 
 
   GOLLUM (CONT’D) 
 Master cares. Master knows.  
 
FRODO looks to GOLLUM, beginning to understand. 
 
   GOLLUM (CONT’D) 
 Yes. Precious.  
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO raises his hand to cover the RING hidden under 
his tunic.  
 
CLOSE ON: GOLLUM mimics his action, watching where FRODO holds. 
 
   GOLLUM (CONT’D) 
 Once it takes hold of us, it never 
 lets go. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO is tranced by the truth of Gollum’s words.  
 
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM reaches out to touch the RING...FRODO comes  
to, and slaps Gollum’s hand away. 
 
   FRODO 
 Don’t touch me! 
 
GOLLUM shrinks away from FRODO. There is a tense moment before 
GOLLUM backs away from FRODO and lies down on the ground.

EXT. THE DEAD MARSHES - DAY 
 
GOLLUM leads SAM and FRODO into an area of the marshes where 
small flames burn on the surface of the mist-covered waters.  
 
ANGLE ON: SAM suddenly stops and glimpses beneath the water’s 
surface. 
 
ANGLE ON: PALLID FACES of dead MEN and ELVES float in the water. 
 
   SAM 
 There are dead things! Dead faces in  
 the water. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO looks to the disturbing sight. 
 
   GOLLUM 
 All dead. All rotten. Elves and Men 
 and Orcses. A great battle long ago.  
 
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM stops and turns to the HOBBITS. 
 
   GOLLUM (CONT’D) 
 Dead Marshes. Yes. Yes, that is their  
 name.  
  (gesturing and moving on) 
 This way. Don’t follow the lights. 
 
ANGLE ON: SAM slips into the water again...GOLLUM turns to  
them quickly. 
 
   GOLLUM (CONT’D) 
 Careful now!  
 
CLOSE ON: The DEAD FACES IN THE WATER. 
 
   GOLLUM (O.S.) (CONT’D) 
 Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones 
 and light little candles of their own. 
 
ANGLE ON: SAM warily follows GOLLUM, but FRODO is drawn toward 
the water.  
 
ANGLE ON: One of the DEAD dressed in ELVEN ARMOUR. It floats  
just beneath the surface with a disturbing peacefulness.  
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO draws himself closer and closer to the water. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
51. 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
ANGLE ON: SAM looks around. His face drops when he sees where 
FRODO is. 
 
   SAM 
 Frodo! 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO pays SAM no mind, but continues to stare at the 
DEAD ELF in the water.  
 
CLOSE ON: SUDDENLY, the Dead Elf’s eyes snap open. Its blank, 
pallid stare looks straight at FRODO.  
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO registers surprise only for a moment before 
falling face-first into the marsh...SAM bolts toward him. 
 
INT. THE DEAD MARSHES - DAY 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO floats beneath the surface. He looks about in 
fear...a decayed face silently screams and moves toward him,  
reaching out its rotten hand... 
 
Panicked, FRODO tries to escape. Two more DEAD grasp him from 
behind. The DEAD quickly surrounded him, grasping with decayed 
limbs.  
 
Another hand reaches around FRODO, and he collapses into the 
dead behind him. 
 
EXT. THE DEAD MARSHES - DAY 
 
GOLLUM pulls FRODO out of the BOG...FRODO gasps and sputters  
for air...GOLLUM drags the struggling FRODO completely out of 
the water, and lays him on the ground.  
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO finally comes to and looks over to his savior, 
in perplexed gratitude and disbelief. 
 
   FRODO 
 Gollum? 
 
   GOLLUM 
  (emphatically) 
 Don’t follow the lights.  
 
He crawls away. SAM runs to Frodo’s side.

night. 
 
PAN OVER THE CAMP: The HOBBITS sleep...or so it appears. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO holds the RING in the palm of his hand,  
caressing it...gazing upon it. 
 
SUDDENLY, he hears GOLLUM. He grasps the RING, as if to hide  
it. 
 
   GOLLUM (O.S.) 
 So bright. So beautiful.  
 
FRODO quickly stuffs the RING inside his shirt.  
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO rolls over. GOLLUM crouches away from him, 
stroking the centre of his palm, just as FRODO was doing only  
a moment before. 
 
   GOLLUM (CONT’D) 
 Our precious. 
 
   FRODO 
 What did you say? 
 
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM calmly turns to FRODO, still lost in his own 
reverie. 
 
   GOLLUM 
 Master should be resting. Master needs 
 to keep up his strength. 
 
FRODO gets up and stands behind GOLLUM.

FRODO crouches behind him. 
 
   FRODO 
 Gandalf told me you were one of the 
 river-folk. 
 
   GOLLUM 
  (absently; ignoring Frodo) 
 Cold be heart and hand and bone 
 Cold be travelers far from home 
 
   FRODO 
 He said your life was a sad story. 
 
   GOLLUM 
 They do not see what lies ahead,   
 when sun has failed and moon is dead. 
 
   FRODO 
 You were not so very different from 
 a Hobbit once. Were you?  
 
He looks closely at GOLLUM, who tries to ignore him. 
 
   FRODO (CONT’D) 
 Sméagol. 
 
CLOSE ON: GOLLUM reacts. He looks up slowly. His face changes to 
that of surprise and wonder. 
 
   GOLLUM 
 What did you call me?

 That was your name once, wasn’t it?  
 A long time ago.

ON THE SOUNDTRACK: A piercing cry breaks the silence of the 
night.  
 
ANGLES ON: SAM snaps around, waking up instantly...FRODO looks

trying to hide.  
 
   SAM 
 Black Riders!

 Hide! Hide!

agony.

FLASH INSERT: Surrounded by the RINGWRAITHS, the WITCH KING  
reels back and stabs FRODO with his blade. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO lurches reliving the act, clutching his  
shoulder...SAM runs over to him...he passes GOLLUM, hiding under 
a small tree. 
 
   SAM 
 Come on, Frodo! Come on! 
 
SAM drags FRODO across the ground toward GOLLUM.  
 
   GOLLUM 
 Quick! They will see us! They will

   GOLLUM (CONT’D) 
 They are calling for it. They are 
 calling for the precious. 
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO hyperventilates and continues clutching the  
RING as it tries to take him and respond to the calls of the 
WRAITHS. SAM grabs Frodo’s hand and shakes him.

of the HOBBITS. LEGOLAS follows closely, and GIMLI joins them. 
ARAGORN suddenly halts, regarding his latest findings. 
 
   ARAGORN 
 These are strange tracks. 
 
   GIMLI 
  (fearful) 
 The air is so close in here. 
 
ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS looks about the forest, as if feeling it. 
 
   LEGOLAS 
 This forest is old. Very old. Full of 
 memory...and anger.  
 
ON THE SOUNDTRACK: Low groans reverberate throughout the  
forest.  
 
ANGLE ON: GIMLI gasps and raises his axe. 
 
   LEGOLAS (CONT’D) 
 The trees are speaking to each other. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
57. 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns to GIMLI, who is fearfully waving his 
axe about, looking for foes. 
 
   ARAGORN 
  (whispering)  
 Gimli! 
 
ANGLE ON: GIMLI starts at the sound of his name. 
 
   ARAGORN (CONT’D) 
  (gesturing)  
 Lower your axe. 
 
GIMLI recollects himself and lowers his axe, as if  
surrendering. 
 
   LEGOLAS 
  (reverently) 
 They have feelings, my friend. The 
 Elves began it. Waking up the 
 trees, teaching them to speak.  
 
   GIMLI 
  (in disbelief) 
 Talking trees. What do trees have  
 to talk about? Except the consistency  
 of squirrel droppings. 
 
They continue walking through the forest.  
 
ANGLE ON: SUDDENLY, LEGOLAS senses something and runs off for a 
better look. 
 
   LEGOLAS 
  (in ELVISH; subtitled) 
 Aragorn, nad nâ ennas!  
 
 Something is out there. 
 
CLOSE ON: LEGOLAS intently searches the FOREST. ARAGORN comes  
up behind him. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
 
58. 
 
CONTINUED: (2) 
 
   ARAGORN 
  (in ELVISH; subtitled) 
 Man cenich?  
 
 What do you see? 
 
   LEGOLAS 
  (whispered) 
 The White Wizard approaches. 
 
CLOSE ON: The THREE HUNTERS weigh the gravity of this 
pronouncement. 
 
   ARAGORN 
  (whispered) 
 Do not let him speak. He will put a 
 spell on us.  
 
CLOSE ON: ARAGORN readies his sword...GIMLI grips his axes... 
LEGOLAS nocks an arrow. 
 
   ARAGORN (CONT’D) 
  (whispered) 
 We must be quick. 
 
QUICK SERIES OF CUTS: WITH A YELL, the three swing round to 
attack...a bright light envelops them from the WIZARD...GIMLI 
throws his axe...it is shattered...LEGOLAS launches an arrow... 
it is deflected...ARAGORN’S sword becomes red hot in his grasp 
...it clatters to the forest floor.  
 
ANGLE ON: The THREE HUNTERS shield their eyes from the blinding 
light emanating from the WHITE WIZARD. 
 
   WHITE WIZARD 
 You are tracking the footsteps of 
 two young Hobbits. 
 
   ARAGORN 
 Where are they? 
 
   WHITE WIZARD 
 They passed this way the day before 
 yesterday. They met someone they 
  did not expect. Does that comfort you? 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
59. 
 
CONTINUED: (3) 
 
   ARAGORN 
 Who are you? Show yourself!  
 
ANGLE ON: The WHITE WIZARD recalls his light...slowly, his face 
is revealed...standing before them, DRESSED ALL IN WHITE, is 
GANDALF!  
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN looks upon him, astounded. 
 
   ARAGORN 
 It cannot be. 
 
   LEGOLAS 
  (kneeling) 
 Forgive me. I mistook you for Saruman. 
 
GIMLI joins LEGOLAS in bowing before the light of GANDALF. 
 
   GANDALF 
 I am Saruman. Or rather, Saruman as he  
 should have been. 
 
   ARAGORN 
 You fell.  
 
   GANDALF 
 Through fire and water.  
 
EXT. DURIN’S TOWER, SILVERTINE - FLASHBACK 
 
WIDE ON: In a raging snowstorm, high atop SILVERTINE in the 
living rock of ZIRAKZIGIL, GANDALF faces off with the BALROG in 
DURIN’S TOWER. 
 
   GANDALF (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
 From the lowest dungeon to the highest 
 peak, I fought with the Balrog of 
 Morgoth.  
 
ANGLE ON: GANDALF holds up GLAMDRING...lightning energizes it.  
 
THE BALROG charges GANDALF again...GANDALF plunges GLAMDRING  
into the BALROG.  
 
WIDE ON: With a final cry, the BALROG falls, smoking, from the 
peak and lands on the icy mountainside.  
 
      (CONTINUED) 
60. 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
   GANDALF (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
 Until at last, I threw down my enemy and 
 smote his ruin upon the mountainside.  
 
ANGLE ON: High above the BALROG, GANDALF lies upon the snowy 
peak, dying. 
 
   GANDALF (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
 Darkness took me, and I strayed out 
 of thought and time.  
 
TRACK IN TO GANDALF’S EYE...A BRIGHT LIGHT erupts... 
 
INSERT IMAGE: DEATH...BIRTH...COSMIC WEIRDNESS... 
 
   GANDALF (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
 Stars wheeled overhead and every day was 
 as long as a life age of the Earth.  
 
WHITE LIGHT ENVELOPES THE IMAGE... 
 
TRACK OUT FROM GANDALF’S EYE... 
 
   GANDALF (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
 But it was not the end. I felt life 
 in me again.  
 
ANGLE ON: GANDALF lies upon the ground - naked, calm, and still. 
His hair has turned white, and his wounds are healed. He 
suddenly utters with a deep gasp and pants as life returns to 
him. 
 
   GANDALF (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
 I've been sent back...  
 
EXT. FANGORN FOREST - DAY 
 
   GANDALF (CONT’D) 
 ...until my task is done. 
 
   ARAGORN 
 Gandalf. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
61. 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
   GANDALF 
  (momentarily confused) 
 Gandalf? Yes.  
  (smiling) 
 That's what they used to call me.  
 
ARAGORN nods...GANDALF looks at ARAGORN, smiling. 
 
   GANDALF (CONT’D) 
 Gandalf the Grey. That was my name.  
 
   GIMLI 
 Gandalf. 
 
   GANDALF 
  (with a smile)  
 I am Gandalf the White.  
 
LEGOLAS grins. 
 
   GANDALF 
 And I come back to you now at the 
 turn of the tide. 
 
EXT. FANGORN FOREST - DAY 
 
WIDE ON: GANDALF leads ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI through the 
forest. He wears his ELVEN CLOAK over his white robes. 
 
   GANDALF (CONT’D) 
 One stage of the journey is over, 
 another begins. We must travel to 
 Edoras with all speed. 
 
   GIMLI 
 Edoras? That is no short distance! 
 
   ARAGORN 
 We hear of trouble in Rohan. It goes ill 
 with the king. 
 
GANDALF stops. 
 
   GANDALF 
 Yes, and it will not be easily cured. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
62. 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
   GIMLI 
 Then we have run all this way for  
 nothing? Are we to leave those poor  
 Hobbits here in this horrid, dark,  
 dank tree-infested--? 
 
WIDE ON: The FOREST responds to Gimli’s complaints with a low 
rumble.  
 
ANGLE ON: GIMLI stops and looks around, fearfully. 
 
   GIMLI (CONT’D) 
 I mean, charming...quite charming forest. 
 
He smiles. The rumbling ceases.  
 
ANGLE ON: GANDALF turns to GIMLI. 
 
   GANDALF 
 It was more than mere chance that 
 brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn. A 
 great power has been sleeping here for 
 many long years. The coming of Merry and 
 Pippin will be like the falling of small 
 stones that starts an avalanche in the 
 mountains. 
 
   ARAGORN 
 In one thing you have not changed, dear 
 friend.  
 
GANDALF leans close to ARAGORN. 
 
   ARAGORN (CONT’D) 
  (low) 
 You still speak in riddles. 
 
They laugh. 
 
   GANDALF 
 A thing is about to happen that has 
 not happened since the Elder Days. The 
 Ents are going to wake up and find that 
 they are strong. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
  
63. 
 
CONTINUED: (2) 
 
   GIMLI 
 Strong?! 
  (smiling nervously) 
 Oh, that’s good. 
 
   GANDALF 
  (turning to leave) 
 So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf. 
 
GANDALF starts walking out of the FOREST again. 
 
   GANDALF (CONT’D) 
 Merry and Pippin are quite safe. In  
 fact, they are far safer than you are  
 about to be. 
 
   GIMLI 
  (to himself) 
 This new Gandalf’s more grumpy than  
 the old one. 
 
GIMLI trudges after the rest of the party. 
 
EXT. BORDER OF FANGORN FOREST - DAY 
 
ANGLE ON: GANDALF whistles piercingly. It echoes off into the 
distance. He whistles again. As the echo dies out, a neigh 
answers him. 
 
ANGLE ON: A magnificent WHITE HORSE gallops towards GANDALF  
over a nearby hill...GANDALF smiles.  
 
ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS, standing with ARAGORN, GIMLI and their  
steeds, looks upon the approaching steed in awe. 
 
   LEGOLAS 
 That is one of the Mearas, unless my 
 eyes are cheated by some spell. 
 
ANGLE ON: The horse gallops across the plain and comes to a stop 
in front of GANDALF.  
   GANDALF 
 Shadowfax. He is the lord of all horses 
 ...and has been my friend through many 
 dangers. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
64.

GANDALF walks up to SHADOWFAX and strokes his neck.

EXT. PLAINS OF ROHAN - DAY 
 
The THREE HUNTERS make haste in riding across the vast plains  
to their destination at EDORAS. 
 
EXT. FANGORN FOREST - DAY 
 
ANGLE ON: TREEBEARD continues his slow trek through the forest. 
MERRY and PIPPIN remain perched in his branches - helplessly  
lead along to whatever fate has in store for them.  
 
   TREEBEARD 
  (passionately) 
 O Rowan mine 
 I saw you shine 
 Upon a summer’s day 
 Upon your head 
 How golden-red 
 The crown you bore aloft 
 
MERRY yawns. 
 
   TREEBEARD (CONT’D) 
 Such a beautiful verse. 
 
   MERRY 
 Is it much further? 
 
   TREEBEARD 
 Bru-ra-hroom. Don’t be hasty. You might 
 call it far, perhaps. My home lies deep 
 in the forest near the roots of the 
 mountain. I told Gandalf I would keep 
 you safe. And safe is where I’ll keep 
 you. I believe you will enjoy this next 
 one too. It’s one of my own 
 compositions. Right. 
 
TREEBEARD clears his throat.  
 
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN settles in to TREEBEARD and closes his eyes.  
 
      (CONTINUED) 
65. 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
AERIAL: Over the mist-covered trees as the sun sets, TREEBEARD 
plods along to his destination. 
 
   TREEBEARD (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
 Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves 
 And the dreams of trees unfold 
 When woodland halls are green and cool 
 And the wind is in the West 
 Come back to me 
 Come back to me 
 And say my land is best 
 
ANGLE ON: TREEBEARD looks over to the HOBBITS to find them 
asleep. 
 
      CUT TO: 
 
EXT. FANGORN FOREST - NIGHT 
 
ANGLE ON: TREEBEARD carefully lays the sleeping HOBBITS on the 
ground.  
 
   TREEBEARD (CONT’D) 
 Sleep, little Shirelings. Heed no  
 nightly noise. Sleep till morning light. 
 
ANGLE ON: TREEBEARD stands back up and walks away, through the 
forest. 
 
   TREEBEARD (CONT’D) 
 I have business in the forest. There  
 are many to call. Many that must come.  
 The Shadow lies on Fangorn. The  
 withering of all woods is drawing near. 
 
WIDE ON: TREEBEARD slowly walks away from the HOBBITS. 
 
EXT. PLAINS OF ROHAN - NIGHT 
 
GANDALF stands on the edge of a small hill overlooking the 
Plains. ARAGORN leaves the fire and joins him. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
66. 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
   GANDALF 
 The veiling shadow that glowers in the  
 east takes shape. Sauron will suffer no  
 rival. From the summit of Barad-dûr, his  
 Eye watches ceaselessly. But he is not  
 so mighty yet that he is above fear.  
 Doubt ever gnaws at him. The rumor has  
 reached him. The heir of Númenor still  
 lives. 
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN looks over to GANDALF to find him already 
looking into his eyes. 
 
   GANDALF (CONT’D) 
 Sauron fears you, Aragorn. He fears  
 what you may become. 
 
ARAGORN looks away, considering these words. GANDALF looks back 
to the east. 
  
   GANDALF (CONT’D) 
 And so he’ll strike hard and fast at  
 the world of Men. He will use his  
 puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan. War  
 is coming. Rohan must defend itself,  
 and therein lies our first challenge  
 for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.  
 The king’s mind is enslaved, it’s an  
 old device of Saruman’s. His hold over  
 King Théoden is now very strong. Sauron  
 and Saruman are tightening the noose.  
 But for all their cunning, we have one  
 advantage. 
 
ARAGORN and GANDALF lock eyes again. 
 
   GANDALF (CONT’D) 
 The Ring remains hidden.  
 
ARAGORN nods. 
 
   GANDALF (CONT’D) 
 And that we should seek to destroy it  
 has not yet entered their darkest dreams.

      (CONTINUED) 
67. 
 
CONTINUED: (2) 
 
   GANDALF (CONT’D) 
 And so the weapon of the enemy is moving  
 towards Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit.  
 Each day brings it closer to the fires  
 of Mount Doom. We must trust now in Frodo.  
 Everything depends upon speed and the  
 secrecy of his quest.  
 
GANDALF looks over to ARAGORN and sees the worry upon his face. 
 
   GANDALF (CONT’D) 
 Do not regret your decision to leave  
 him. Frodo must finish this task alone.  
 
   ARAGORN 
 He’s not alone. Sam went with him. 
 
GANDALF looks over to ARAGORN, surprise alighting on his face. 
 
   GANDALF 
  (smiling) 
 Did he? Did he, indeed? Good. 
 
He looks back to the landscape. 
 
   GANDALF (CONT’D) 
 Yes, very good.

 The Black Gate of Mordor. 
 
WIDE ON: The enormous BLACK GATE OF MORDOR guards the way to 
MORDOR with Orcs patrolling and standing guard in the TEETH OF 
MORDOR and atop the walls.

   SAM 
 Oh, save us.  
 
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM hides his face in his hands...SAM scrambles 
along EPHEL DÚATH and hides behind a rock...FRODO comes up 
quickly behind him. 
 
   SAM (CONT’D) 
 My old Gaffer would have a thing or 
 two to say if he could see us now. 
 
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM scramble up behind them. 
 
   GOLLUM 
 Master says to show him the way 
 into Mordor. So good Sméagol does, 
 master says so. 
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO looks upon the GATE, wide-eyed, only now 
comprehending the gravity of the request. 
 
   FRODO 
 I did. 
 
INTERCUT WITH: ORCS stand guard and patrol atop the MASSIVE  
BLACK GATE BATTLEMENTS. 
 
ANGLE ON: The HOBBITS and GOLLUM looking in wonder at the Gate. 
SAM’S expression drops as he turns to FRODO. 
 
   SAM 
 That’s it then. We can’t get past 
 that. 
 
HIGH ANGLE ON: An army of EASTERLING SOLDIERS marches to the 
Black Gate on a path far below EPHEL DÚATH. A COMMANDER screams 
orders to the TROOPS. 
 
ANGLE ON: The THREE shrink away from the edge of the overlook.  
 
ANGLE ON: The ARMY marches steadily towards the BLACK GATE. A  
HORN SOUNDS their arrival. 
 
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM whimpers and cringes from the sound. FRODO 
looks to him for a moment, and then returns his gaze to the 
ARMY. 
 
69. 
 
EXT. BLACK GATE BATTLEMENTS - DAY 
 
ANGLES ON: An ORC SOUNDS the HORN again...two enormous CAVE 
TROLLS work the MECHANISM to open the mighty gate...the ORCS  
atop the BATTLEMENTS brace themselves as the GATE slowly  
opens...the MIGHTY CAVE TROLLS open the heavy gate, walking 
along a thin walkway patrolled by the smaller ORCS. 
 
EXT. EPHEL DÚATH - DAY 
 
ANGLE ON: SAM points to the BLACK GATE. 
 
   SAM (CONT’D) 
 Look! The gate. It's opening!  
 
HIGH WIDE ON: The BLACK GATE slowly opens to receive the 
approaching ARMY. 
 
ANGLE ON: SAM crawls to a rock at the edge of the overlook. 
 
   SAM (CONT’D) 
 I can see a way down. 
 
SUDDENLY, THE ROCK GIVES WAY UNDER SAM AND RACES DOWN THE SIDE 
OF EPHEL DÚATH WITH SAM RIDING ATOP IT! 
 
   FRODO 
 Sam, no! 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO scrambles after SAM. GOLLUM breaks from his 
cowering to look up as FRODO runs off. 
 
   GOLLUM 
 Master! 
 
FRODO runs and slides down the side of EPHEL DÚATH. 
 
EXT. BASE OF EPHEL DÚATH - DAY 
 
FRODO slides to a stop behind a rock near the bottom. 
 
ANGLE ON: One of the EASTERLING SOLDIERS looks up at the 
mountainside.

DÚATH some more and comes to rest behind another rock.

ANGLE ON: TWO EASTERLING SOLDIERS approach the mountainside to 
investigate.

is buried to his waist in rocks. FRODO struggles to free SAM to 
no avail. 
 
POV: The EASTERLING SOLDIERS come ever closer... 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO struggles desperately to get SAM loose. 
 
POV: The EASTERLING SOLDIERS are nearly upon them... 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO quickly swings his ELVISH CLOAK over himself and 
SAM.  
 
LOW ANGLE ON: The EASTERLING SOLDIERS reach the base of EPHEL 
DÚATH. They survey the mountainside. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM huddle beneath FRODO’S CLOAK, not daring 
to breathe. 
 
POV THROUGH CLOAK: One of the EASTERLINGS stands almost directly 
over FRODO and SAM 
 
They lie directly in the path of the SOLDIERS, holding their 
breath. The SOLDIERS stop in front of them and look at the 
mountainside. 
 
ANGLE ON: The EASTERLING SOLDIERS look at each other for a 
moment, shrug, and rejoin their party. 
 
CLOSE ON: A ROCK in the gravel directly in front of the 
EASTERLINGS’ position...the surface of the ROCK suddenly peels 
back to reveal FRODO and SAM beneath it. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM desperately dig SAM out. With SAM free, 
they scramble behind a nearby boulder. 
 
ANGLE ON: The ARMY marches through the BLACK GATE. ORDERS are 
shouted to the TROOPS and ORCS.

SUDDENLY, as they start to run, HANDS grab them from behind and 
drag them to the ground. 
 
   GOLLUM  
 No! No! No master!  
 
FRODO and SAM look angrily at GOLLUM. FRODO turns desperately to 
the GATE.  
 
   GOLLUM (CONT’D) 
 They catch you! They catch you!  
 
FRODO tries to run for it again, but GOLLUM detains him. 
 
   GOLLUM (CONT’D) 
 Don’t take it to him.  
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO looks curiously at GOLLUM. 
 
CLOSE ON: GOLLUM looks desperately back to them. 
 
   GOLLUM (CONT’D) 
  (ominously) 
 He wants the precious. Always he is 
 looking for it. And the precious is 
 wanting to go back to him.  
  (evilly) 
 But we mustn’t let him have it. 
 
ANGLE ON: The EASTERLING ARMY progresses through THE BLACK  
GATE. A HORN SOUNDS. The GATE begins to close behind them.

   SAM 
 Why haven’t you spoken of this before?! 
 
   GOLLUM 
 Because Master did not ask. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO turns to him quickly. SAM tosses GOLLUM aside. 
 
   SAM 
 He’s up to something. 
 
   FRODO 
 Are you saying there’s another way 
 into Mordor? 
 
   GOLLUM 
  (nodding) 
 Yes. There’s a path...and some stairs... 
 and then...a tunnel.  
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM watch the BLACK GATE close. GOLLUM  
buries his face in FRODO’S CLOAK as FRODO turns away from his 
former goal. FRODO looks at GOLLUM. 
 
   FRODO 
 He’s led us this far, Sam. 
 
   SAM 
  (desperately) 
 Mr. Frodo, no. 
 
   FRODO 
 He’s been true to his word.

A small brook bubbles down the center of the draft. PIPPIN sits 
on a root, drinking the water.

 Where’s he gone? 
 
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN sits up, holding a bowl of the water. 
 
   PIPPIN 
 I had the loveliest dream last  
 night. There was this large barrel,

 all of it. And then...you were sick.

direction. 
 
   MERRY 
 Did you hear that? 
 
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN gathers his water pitchers...MERRY walks in  
the direction of the issuing sound. Another GROAN breaks the 
silence of the forest. 
 
   MERRY (CONT’D) 
 There it is again. Something’s not  
 right here. Not right at all. 
 
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN climbs off of the root to the ground ... and 
issues his own sound: an LOW GRUNT.  
 
CLOSE ON: MERRY looks over to him, wide-eyed. 
 
   MERRY (CONT’D) 
 You just said something ... Treeish. 
 
   PIPPIN 
 No, I didn’t. I was just stretching.

 Three-foot-six? At the most? 
 
MERRY shrugs as if to say, “Yeah.” 
 
   PIPPIN (CONT’D) 
 Whereas me, I’m pushing 3’7”. 
 
Another groan issues from PIPPIN, and he grows again.  
 
CLOSE ON: MERRY’S eyes grow wide. 
 
   PIPPIN (CONT’D) 
  (smiling) 
 3’8”! 
 
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN happily takes another huge gulp of the water.  
 
CLOSE ON: MERRY looks on in shock. 
 
   MERRY 
 Three-foot-eight. 
 
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN shrugs, as if to say, “Yeah.” 
 
   MERRY (CONT’D) 
 You did something. 
 
PIPPIN shrugs again and smiles.  
 
ANGLE ON: He non-chalantly places the WATER BOWL next to the 
brook...MERRY looks at the water, and then snatches the  
water jug and takes a huge drink.

   PIPPIN 
 Merry don’t! Don’t drink it! 
 
MERRY takes off with the jug. PIPPIN chases him. He takes  
another drink, pushing PIPPIN away. 
 
   PIPPIN (CONT’D) 
 Merry! No, Treebeard said that you  
 shouldn’t have any. 
 
PIPPIN tries to grab MERRY again, but MERRY pushes him away and 
runs off to take another drink. 
 
   MERRY 
 I want some! 
 
   PIPPIN 
 It could well be dangerous! 
 
ANGLE ON: MERRY leads PIPPIN across some large tree roots. 
 
   PIPPIN (CONT’D) 
 Give me it back. Merry! 
 
SUDDENLY, MERRY slips between two of the roots, and the tree 
groans and moves.  
 
CLOSE ON: It closes its roots to traps the ankles of both 
HOBBITS. 
 
   PIPPIN (CONT’D) 
 What’s happening! 
 
   MERRY 
 It’s got my leg! 
 
SERIES OF CUTS: The TREE moves its roots to traps the HOBBITS’ 
limbs. 
 
   PIPPIN 
 Merry! 
 
ANGLE ON: The tree pulls them into its roots as others close in 
over them.  
 
      (CONTINUED) 
77. 
 
CONTINUED: (5) 
 
Disturbed leaves from above cover the HOBBITS, making them 
virtually invisible as they scream. The roots finish the job and 
completely bury the HOBBITS. 
 
   PIPPIN (CONT’D) 
  (muffled) 
 Help! 
 
WIDE ON: Silence fills the air as the scene looks serene - as  
if nothing sinister happened at all.  
 
ON THE SOUNDTRACK: Large footfalls ECHO.  
 
TREEBEARD quickly approaches the tree. 
 
   TREEBEARD 
 Away with you. You should not be  
 waking. Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink  
 water. 
 
ANGLES ON: The roots move again, releasing the HOBBITS. With 
desperate cries, they free themselves from the tree’s grasp. 
 
   TREEBEARD (CONT’D) 
 Go to sleep. Away with you. 
 
The HOBBITS shake off the leaves and stand by TREEBEARD,  
looking back at the tree roots in horror. 
 
   TREEBEARD (CONT’D) 
 Come, the forest is waking up. It  
 isn’t safe. 
 
ANGLE ON: TREEBEARD lifts the HOBBITS, one in each hand, and  
walks out of the grove.

78. 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
   TREEBEARD (CONT’D) 
 The trees have grown wild and  
 dangerous. Anger festers in their  
 hearts. Black are their thoughts.  
 Strong is their hate. They will  
 harm you if they can. There are too  
 few of us now. Too few of us Ents  
 left to manage them.  
 
   PIPPIN 
 Why are there so few of you when you  
 have lived so long? Are there Ent  
 children? 
 
   TREEBEARD 
 Bru-ra-hroom. There have been no Entings  
 for a terrible long count of years.  
 
   MERRY 
 Why is that? 
 
   TREEBEARD 
 We lost the Entwives. 
 
   PIPPIN 
 Oh, I’m sorry. How did they die? 
 
   TREEBEARD 
 Die? No. We lost them. And now we  
 cannot find them. I don’t suppose  
 you’ve seen Entwives in the Shire? 
 
   MERRY 
  (hesitantly) 
 Can’t say that I have. You, Pip? 
 
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN stares off blankly, and then shakes his head. 
 
   PIPPIN 
 What do they look like? 
 
   TREEBEARD 
  (sighs deeply) 
 I don’t remember now.  
 
They continue their walk through the forest.

WIDE ON: The FOUR FIGURES look upon a walled city covering a 
small mountain. Atop its summit is MEDUSELD. 
 
   GANDALF 
 Edoras and the Golden Hall of Meduseld. 
 There dwells Théoden, King of Rohan... 
 
INT. MEDUSELD THRONE ROOM - DAY 
 
HIGH WIDE ON: THÉODEN, grayed and ancient, sits upon his throne, 
head bowed for he is hardly able to hold it up. ÉOWYN kneels 
beside him, holding his hand comfortingly. 
 
   GANDALF (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
 whose mind is overthrown. Saruman’s 
 hold over King Théoden is now very 
 strong. 
 
CLOSE ON: ÉOWYN gently strokes the KING’S HAND. 
 
   ÉOWYN 
 My lord, your son...he is dead.  
 
ANGLE ON: ÉOWYN looks at THÉODEN, tearfully, when he fails to 
respond. 
 
   ÉOWYN (CONT’D) 
 My lord? Uncle?  
 
ANGLE ON: THÉODEN stares forward a moment. His eyes are clouded, 
as if blind. Slowly he moves his eyes to look at her, but he 
remains expressionless. 
 
   ÉOWYN (CONT’D) 
  (pleading) 
 Will you not go to him? Will you do 
 nothing? 
 
THÉODEN continues to look at her, blankly.

EXT. PLAINS OF ROHAN - DAY 
 
ANGLE ON: The THREE HUNTERS sit atop their steeds, listening to 
GANDALF. 
 
   GANDALF

ANGLE ON: THÉODRED lies dead upon his bed.  
 
ANGLE ON: ÉOWYN kneels beside him, weeping.  
 
ANGLE ON: A shadow moves in the hall behind her. She pays it no 
mind. WORMTONGUE appears at the door. He looks upon her, 
concerned. 
 
   WORMTONGUE 
 Oh, he must have died sometime in the 
 night. What a tragedy for the king to 
 lose his only son and heir.  
 
He sits on the bed and puts a hand on ÉOWYN’S shoulder. 
 
   WORMTONGUE (CONT’D) 
 I understand. His passing is hard to 
 accept. Especially now that your brother 
 has deserted you. 
 
ÉOWYN jumps up and throws off his hand. 
 
   EÓWYN 
 Leave me alone, snake! 
 
She backs away from him. WORMTONGUE rises and moves over to her. 
 
   WORMTONGUE 
  (suddenly sinister) 
 Oh, but you are alone. Who knows what 
 you’ve spoken to the darkness in the 
 bitter watches of the night when all 
 your life seems to shrink. The walls of 
 your bower closing in about you. A hutch 
 to trammel some wild thing in.  
 
      (CONTINUED) 
81. 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
He stops in front of her and stares into her eyes. She seems 
transfixed by him. He puts a hand on the side of her face as he 
speaks. 
 
   WORMTONGUE (CONT’D)  
 So fair, so cold. Like a morning pale 
 spring still clinging to winter's chill. 
 
She closes her eyes as if affected by his words. He moves his 
hand to her throat.  
 
CLOSE ON: She suddenly opens her eyes and looks through him. 
 
ANGLE ON: WORMTONGUE starts back away. 
 
   ÉOWYN 
  (angrily) 
 Your words are poison. 
 
ANGLE ON: ÉOWYN abruptly leaves the room. WORMTONGUE appears 
taken aback by the sudden change in her. 
 
EXT. MEDUSELD - DAY 
 
ÉOWYN throws open the main doors and charges outside. She walks 
to the brink of the porch outside the hall and looks far-off 
into the distance, as if hoping to find someone there. She walks 
impatiently from one side of the platform to the other. Far 
below, something catches her eye. 
 
POV: Three horses approach EDORAS.  
 
ANGLE ON: The wind tears a flag off its mast and carries it 
across the city. 
 
EXT. GATES OF EDORAS - DAY 
 
ANGLE ON: GANDALF, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI ride through the gate. As 
ARAGORN approaches, the FLAG flutters to the ground. He looks to 
its source as if it were a bad omen. 
 
EXT. EDORAS - DAY 
 
As the Four Riders ride through EDORAS, the people eye them 
silently and warily, as if they come as harbingers of doom.

EXT. MEDUSELD - DAY 
 
ANGLE ON: The doors of the Golden Hall open and HÁMA exits, 
followed by a small detachment.  
 
ANGLE ON: The Four climb the steps, and HÁMA meets them at the 
top. GANDALF leans heavily on his staff, like an old man. He 
looks up to HÁMA and smiles. 
 
   HÁMA 
 I cannot allow you before Théoden King 
 so armed, Gandalf Greyhame. By order of 
 Gríma Wormtongue. 
 
CLOSE ON: GANDALF nods to the others to surrender their  
weapons.  
 
ANGLES ON: Almost comically, they turn over every weapon they 
have: SWORDS...KNIVES...ARROWS...and AXES.  
 
CLOSE ON: HÁMA signals to GANDALF. 
 
   HÁMA (CONT’D) 
 Your staff. 
 
ANGLE ON: GANDALF glances at his staff and scoffs innocently. 
 
   GANDALF 
 You would not part an old man from 
 his walking stick. 
 
He continues to look at HÁMA innocently.  
 
ANGLE ON: HÁMA nods, rolls his eyes, and then gestures for them 
to follow him.  
 
      (CONTINUED) 
83.

ANGLE ON: GANDALF gives a wink to ARAGORN, who smiles in  
return. GANDALF follows HÁMA into the hall, leaning on Legolas’ 
arm as an old man might for support.

HÁMA enters the hall and bows before the King. He steps aside to 
allow the Four to enter behind him.

   WORMTONGUE 
 My lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.  
 
ANGLE ON: THE FOUR continue walking toward THÉODEN. GUARDS close 
the doors behind them.  
 
POV: They notice several Men behind the contingency of GUARDS 
following them as they walk towards the King.  
 
   WORMTONGUE (CONT’D) 
 He’s a herald of woe. 
 
ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS releases GANDALF’S ARM.  
 
   GANDALF 
 The courtesy of your hall is somewhat 
 lessened of late, Théoden King. 
 
   WORMTONGUE 
  (whispered to THÉODEN)  
 He’s not welcome. 
 
   THÉODEN 
  (labored) 
 Why should I welcome you, Gandalf 
 Stormcrow?  
 
He looks to WORMTONGUE for affirmation, who nods. 
 
   WORMTONGUE 
 A just question, my liege.  
 
WORMTONGUE stands before them. He walks to meet them well in 
front of THÉODEN.

84.

   WORMTONGUE (CONT’D) 
 Late is the hour in which this conjurer 
 chooses to appear. Láthspell spell I 
 name him. Ill news is an ill guest. 
 
   GANDALF 
 Be silent.  
 
ANGLE ON: WORMTONGUE freezes in his tracks. 
 
   GANDALF (CONT’D) 
 Keep your forked tongue behind your 
 teeth. I have not passed through fire 
 and death to bandy crooked words with a 
 witless worm. 
 
He raises his staff to WORMTONGUE. WORMTONGUE back away from  
it. 
 
   WORMTONGUE 
 His staff. 
 
He backs well away from GANDALF while addressing the guards, 
arrogantly.  
 
   WORMTONGUE (CONT’D) 
 I told you to take the wizard’s  
 staff. 
 
ANGLES ON: The MEN behind the lines burst through to ATTACK... 
ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI engage them in a fist-fight to keep 
them from GANDALF as he approaches THÉODEN.

ANGLE ON: GANDALF reaches out to THÉODEN. 
 
   GANDALF 
 Théoden, son of Thengel...

his eyes. 
 
   THÉODEN 
  (laughing) 
 You have no power here, Gandalf the 
 Grey. 
 
ANGLE ON: Angered, GANDALF throws back his grey cloak and  
spreads his hands. A blinding white light issues from him.  
 
ANGLE ON: THÉODEN is thrown back against his seat.  
 
   GANDALF 
 I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is 
 drawn from a wound.  
 
He thrusts his staff towards THÉODEN. The force knocks THÉODEN 
back in his throne. GANDALF moves in closer.  
 
ANGLE ON: ÉOWEN rushes in. Thinking THÉODEN is in trouble, she 
tries to run to him, but ARAGORN stops her. 
 
   ARAGORN 
 Wait.

GANDALF thrusts his staff again and throwing THÉODEN/SARUMAN  
back again.

 You did not kill me, you will not kill 
 him.

welling in his eyes.

 Rohan is mine. 
 
THÉODEN/SARUMAN struggles against Gandalf’s power.

 Be gone.

him, and he is thrown back into the chair.

steady.

ÉOWYN weeps with joy. THÉODEN looks up and is surprised to see 
GANDALF standing over him.

 Gandalf? 
 
   GANDALF 
 Breathe the free air again, my friend. 
 
THÉODEN rises to his feet and looks over his Hall.  
 
   THÉODEN 
 Dark have been my dreams of late.  
 
He looks down at his trembling hands. 
 
   GANDALF 
 Your fingers would remember their old 
 strength better if they grasped your 
 sword.

THÉODEN continues his advance toward WORMTONGUE. 
 
   THÉODEN 
 Your leechcraft would have had me 
 crawling on all fours like a beast! 
 
   WORMTONGUE 
 Send me not from your sight. 
 
THÉODEN raises HERUGRIM to kill WORMTONGUE. ARAGORN stops him. 
 
   ARAGORN 
 No, my lord! No, my lord. Let him go. 
 Enough blood has been spilt on his 
 account. 
 
THÉODEN looks at ARAGORN and relents. ARAGORN offers his hand to 
WORMTONGUE, but WORMTONGUE spits in it and scrambles to his 
feet. ARAGORN shakes off the spittle 
 
ANGLE ON: WORMTONGUE violently pushes his way through the CROWD

 forebearers.  
 
He turns to GANDALF.

KING’S decision. 
 
   HÁMA 
 By order of the king, the city must 
 empty. We make for the refuge of Helm’s 
 Deep. Do not burden yourself with 
 treasures. Take only what provisions you 
 need. 
 
ANGLES ON: The PEOPLE OF EDORAS gather their things together... 
ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, GIMLI, and GANDALF walk among them.

   GIMLI 
 Who will defend them if not their king? 
     
   ARAGORN 
 He’s only doing what he thinks is best 
 for his people. Helm’s Deep has saved 
 them in the past.  
 
ARAGORN and GANDALF approach the stable of SHADOWFAX. 
 
   GANDALF 
 There is no way out of that ravine. 
 Théoden is walking into a trap. He thinks 
 he’s leading them to safety. What they 
 will get is a massacre. 
 
CLOSE ON: GANDALF turns to ARAGORN. 
 
   GANDALF (CONT’D) 
  (grim) 
  Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for 
 him. I fear for the survival of Rohan. He 
 will need you before the end, Aragorn. 
 The people of Rohan will need you. The 
 defenses have to hold. 
 
CLOSE ON: ARAGORN holds GANDALF’S gaze resolutely. 
 
   ARAGORN 
 They will hold. 
 
ANGLE ON: GANDALF turns from ARAGORN to SHADOWFAX. Gently, he 
strokes the mighty horse’s coat. 
 
   GANDALF 
  (musing) 
 The Grey Pilgrim. That’s what they used 
 to call me. Three hundred lives of Men 
 I’ve walked this earth, and now I have 
 no time.

SHADOWFAX.

stallion, BREGO, with little success...ÉOWYN turns to them, 
watching. 
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN enters carrying his saddle...he turns to the 
struggle...he puts down his saddle and walks to them. 
 
   SOLDIER 
 That horse is half mad, my lord.  
 There’s nothing you can do. Leave 
 him. 
 
ANGLE ON: BREGO rears and whinnies as ARAGORN comes closer. 
 
   ARAGORN 
  (in OLD ENGLISH) 
  Fæste, stille nú...fæste...

ARAGORN slowly reaches BREGO...he caresses the beast’s coat... 
carefully, he removes the ropes detaining BREGO...he hands them 
to the other SOLDIER...ÉOWYN watches with wonder.

 Hwæt nemnað ðe? Hm? Hwæt nemnað ðe?  
 
 What is your name? Hm? What is your  
 name? 
 
   ÉOWYN 
 His name is Brego.  
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN snaps around to look at ÉOWYN. 
 
   ÉOWYN (CONT’D) 
 He was my cousin’s horse. 
 
   ARAGORN 
 Brego.  
  (to BREGO; in OLD ENGLISH) 
 Ðin nama is cynglic.  
 
 Your name is kingly. 
 
CLOSE ON: ÉOWYN moves slowly to ARAGORN as he speaks,  
transfixed.

 you see?

   ÉOWYN 
 I have heard of the magic of Elves, but  
 I did not look for it in a Ranger from  
 the North. You speak as one of their own. 
 
   ARAGORN 
 I was raised in Rivendell ... for a  
 time. Turn this fellow free. He’s seen  
 enough of war. 
 
ARAGORN leaves BREGO with ÉOWYN...he retrieves his saddle and

 Gandalf the White. Gandalf the Fool!  
 Does he seek to humble me with his  
 newfound piety?  
 
ANGLE ON: WORMTONGUE enters slowly and moves to SARUMAN... 
SARUMAN stands suddenly still, a look of disgust crossing his 
face. 
 
   WORMTONGUE 
 There were three who followed the 
 wizard. An Elf, a Dwarf, and a Man. 
 
SARUMAN sniffs.

 No, from the North. One of the Dúnedain  
 Rangers, I thought he was.  
 
CLOSE ON: SARUMAN suddenly shows much interest. 
 
   WORMTONGUE (CONT’D) 
 His cloth was poor. And yet he bore  
 a strange ring. Two serpents with  
 emerald eyes. One devouring, the other  
 crowned with golden flowers.

behind him at the door. 
 
   SARUMAN 
 The Ring of Barahir. So Gandalf Greyhame  
 thinks he has found Isildur’s heir. The  
 lost king of Gondor. He is a fool. The  
 line was broken years ago. 
 
CLOSE ON: SARUMAN closes his book and pushes it aside.

 It matters not. The world of Men shall

 I am ready, Gamling. Bring my horse. 
 
GAMLING bows and walks to the door, silently, shoulders 
slumped... 
 
   THÉODEN (CONT’D) 
 This is not a defeat.  
 
GAMLING turns to him...

she unsheathes it and holds it before her, running her hand down 
the flat side of the blade, smiling...deliberately, she 
practices her swing. 
 
POV: Someone approaches from behind...she swings it behind her! 
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN meets her swing with his DAGGER. ÉOWYN’S face 
does not soften at his gaze. 
 
   ARAGORN 
 You have some skill with a blade. 
 
With a swift move, ÉOWYN swings her sword, throwing ARAGORN’S  
arm and knife to one side, rendering him vulnerable and  
gaining the upper hand... 
 
He lowers his weapon...she does likewise and steps away.

chest. 
 
   ARAGORN 
 What do you fear, my lady? 
 
CLOSE ON: She freezes for a moment...she turns to him. 
 
   ÉOWYN 
  (gravely) 
 A cage. To stay behind bars until use 
 and old age accept them. And all chance 
 of valor has gone beyond recall or 
 desire. 
 
CLOSE ON: ARAGORN shakes his head in wonder. 
 
   ARAGORN 
 You’re a daughter of kings, a 
 shieldmaiden of Rohan.

her.

INTERCUT WITH: SARUMAN patiently listens to WORMTONGUE in 
ORTHANC. 
 
   WORMTONGUE (CONT’D) 
 It’s vulnerable. He knows this. He will 
 expect an attack on the city. They will 
 flee to Helm’s Deep, the great fortress 
 of Rohan.  
 
ANGLES ON: The ROHIRRIM make their way towards the mountains 
where HELM’S DEEP lies...some falter...some ride in carts...ever 
so slowly, they draw closer to their destination. 
 
   WORMTONGUE (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
 It is a dangerous road to take through 
 the mountains. They will be slow.

 Hey, stinker, don’t go getting too far 
 ahead! 
 
   FRODO 
 Why do you do that? 
 
SAM stops and turns to FRODO. 
 
   SAM 
 What? 
 
   FRODO 
 Call him names. Run him down all the 
 time. 
 
   SAM 
 Because. Because that's what he is, Mr. 
 Frodo. There's naught left in him but 
 lies and deceit. It's the Ring he wants. 
 It's all he cares about. 
 
   FRODO 
  (angrily) 
 You have no idea what it did to him... 
 what it's still doing to him.  
 
He pushes past SAM and stops.

 You can’t save him, Mr. Frodo. 
 
   FRODO

 What do you know about it? Nothing!  
 
SAM is taken aback. Slowly, he walks past FRODO. FRODO turns to 
him. 
 
   FRODO (CONT’D) 
 I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know why I  
 said that.  
 
SAM turns back to FRODO. 
 
   SAM 
  (gently) 
 I do. It's the Ring. You can't take your 
 eyes off it! I've seen you. You're not 
 eating. You barely sleep. It's taken hold 
 of you, Mr. Frodo. You have to fight it. 
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO’S eyes flare again... 
 
   FRODO 
  (angrily) 
 I know what I have to do Sam. The Ring 
 was entrusted to me. It's my task. Mine! 
 My own!  
 
FRODO storms away. SAM turns to him, shocked.

 Wicked. Tricksy. False. 
 
Suddenly, his expression softens, and he shakes his head. His 
eyes grow wide, as if looking at his GOLLUM half. 
 
   SMÉAGOL 
 No. Not Master. 
 
His expression turns to hate again. His head turns as if 
responding to the SMÉAGOL half.  
 
   GOLLUM 
 Yes, precious. False. They will 
 cheat you, hurt you, lie! 
 
   SMÉAGOL 
 Master’s my friend.

 You don’t have any friends. Nobody

exchange stresses him. He holds his head and speaks in a small 
voice.

 I hate you. I hate you.

 Eh?

searching for its source. 
 
   SAM 
  (impatiently) 
 Po-ta-toes. Boil them, mash them, stick 
 them in a stew. Lovely big golden chips 
 with a nice piece of fried fish.  
 
GOLLUM spits at the very thought. SAM looks to him, proud of his 
imagery.

 Even you couldn’t say no to that.

 Oh, yes, we could. Spoil a nice fish.

CLOSE ON: FARAMIR rolls the SOLDIER over with his foot and looks 
upon his dead face. 
 
   FARAMIR (CONT’D) 
 You wonder what his name is, where he 
 came from. And if he was really evil at 
 heart. What lies or threats led him on 
 this long march from home. If he would 
 not rather have stayed there...in peace.  
 
He breaks from his reflection and turns back to FRODO. 
 
   FARAMIR (CONT’D) 
 War will make corpses of us all. Bind  
 their hands. 
 
ANGLES ON: FRODO makes a final fruitless effort to escape, but  
to no avail...SAM is violently lifted from the ground.

ANGLE ON: GIMLI rides atop a horse, led by ÉOWYN, among the 
throng of traveling ROHIRRIM. 
 
   GIMLI 
 It’s true you don’t see many Dwarf 
 women. And in fact, they are so alike in 
 voice and appearance, that they’re often 
 mistaken for Dwarf Men.  
 
ANGLE ON: ÉOWYN smiles and looks back at ARAGORN. 
 
   ARAGORN 
  (gestures and whispers)  
 It’s the beards. 
 
ÉOWYN smiles and shushes him.

   GIMLI 
 And this, in turn, has given rise to the 
 belief that there are no Dwarf women, and 
 that Dwarves just spring out of holes in 
 the ground... 
 
ÉOWYN laughs. GIMLI joins her and continues. 
 
   GIMLI (CONT’D) 
 ...which is of course ridiculous. 
 
The horse suddenly rears up. ÉOWYN loses her hold on the reins. 
 
ANGLES ON: The horse gallops through the throng, throwing  
GIMLI to the dirt...ÉOWYN rushes forward to GIMLI who struggles 
to get up like a turtle on its back. 
 
   GIMLI (CONT’D) 
 It’s all right. Nobody panic. That was 
 deliberate. It was deliberate. 
 
ÉOWYN helps GIMLI to his feet.  
 
ANGLE ON: THÉODEN and ARAGORN, riding side by side, laugh at  
the sight...THÉODEN glances at ARAGORN. 
 
   THÉODEN 
 I haven’t seen my niece smile for a  
 long time. She was a girl when they  
 brought her father back dead. Cut down  
 by Orcs. She watched her mother succumb  
 to grief.  
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN’S expression turns dark and mournful...he  
looks to ÉOWYN. 
 
POV: ÉOWYN laughs and looks to him as she brushes GIMLI off.  
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN looks back to THÉODEN. 
 
   THÉODEN (CONT’D) 
 Then she was left alone, to tend her  
 king in growing fear. Doomed to wait  
 upon an old man who should have loved  
 her as a father.

carrying a pot of stew...she sees GIMLI and offers him some. 
 
   ÉOWYN 
 Gimli.  
 
   GIMLI 
 No, I couldn’t. I really couldn’t. 
 
GIMLI walks away. ÉOWYN continues walking until she comes upon 
ARAGORN. He looks up at her approach. 
 
   ÉOWYN 
 I made some stew. It isn’t much, but  
 it’s hot. 
 
She draws him a bowl, and he takes it. She hands him a spoon. 
 
   ARAGORN 
 Thank you. 
 
CLOSE ON: He dips the spoon in the bowl and fishes for a bite of 
meat.  
 
Immediately upon putting the morsel into his mouth, he  
freezes...his face registers the distaste of this morsel... 
meekly, he looks up to ÉOWYN...he swallows hard, and nods with 
the word “Yuck” written all over his face. 
 
   ARAGORN (CONT’D) 
 It’s good.

 Really? 
 
She begins to walk away.

distasteful mixture...ÉOWYN turns suddenly...ARAGORN tries to 
catch himself, but ends up soaking his arms in the steaming 
brew. 
 
   ÉOWYN (CONT’D) 
 My uncle told me a strange thing. He  
 said that you rode to war with Thengel,  
 my grandfather. But he must be mistaken.  
 
   ARAGORN 
 King Théoden has a good memory. He was  
 only a small child at the time. 
 
ANGLE ON: ÉOWYN kneels down to him, shocked. 
 
   ÉOWYN 
 Then you must be at least 60. 
 
CLOSE ON: He chuckles uncomfortably, and looks away. 
 
   ÉOWYN (CONT’D) 
 Seventy? 
 
ARAGORN looks down and still doesn’t respond. 
 
   ÉOWYN (CONT’D) 
 But you cannot be 80! 
 
He looks at her calmly, and smiles. 
 
   ARAGORN 
 Eighty-seven. 
 
CLOSE ON: ÉOWYN’S jaw DROPS...she stands, momentarily  
speechless. 
 
   ÉOWYN 
 You are one of the Dúnedain.  
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN nods, humbly. 
 
   ÉOWYN (CONT’D) 
 A descendant of Númenor, blessed with  
 long life. It was said that your race  
 had passed into legend.

 The light of the Evenstar does not

 Sleep.

ANGLE ON: ÉOWYN runs through the city to meet them. She surveys 
their numbers quickly. 
 
   ÉOWYN 
 So few. So few of you have returned.  
 
ANGLE ON: THÉODEN turns to her, finding his words. He averts  
his gaze as much as possible. 
 
   THÉODEN 
 Our people are safe.  
 
He turns to assist a wounded soldier who was riding with him. 
 
   THÉODEN (CONT’D) 
 We have paid for it with many lives.

 My lady.  
 
She turns to him, worried. 
 
   ÉOWYN 
 Lord Aragorn ... where is he?  
 
   GIMLI 
  (with difficulty) 
 He fell. 
 
SLOW MOTION: ÉOWYN’S eyes grow wide...her mouth drops open, 
speechless...she turns to looks at THÉODEN...THÉODEN catches her 
glance, and turns away, confirming GIMLI’S statement...visibly 
shaken, ÉOWYN sits to recover herself.

EXT. HELM’S DEEP BATTLEMENTS - DAY 
 
WIDE ON: THÉODEN stands, overlooking the land outside of HELM’S 
DEEP. He addresses the SOLDIERS and MEN accompanying him. 
 
   THÉODEN 
 Draw all our forces behind the wall.  
 Bar the gate. And set a watch on the 
 surround. 
 
THÉODEN turns to leave the BATTLEMENTS. The MEN follow. 
 
   GAMLING

 Get them into the caves.  
 
EXT. HELM’S DEEP - DAY 
 
ANGLE ON: THÉODEN leads his MEN down from the BATTLEMENTS and 
past the DEEPING STREAM, which flows through it via a grate in 
the wall. 
 
   THÉODEN (CONT’D) 
 Saruman's arm will have grown long  
 indeed if he thinks he can reach us  
 here.   
 
TRACK IN ON THE GRATE IN THE WALL. 
 
   WORMTONGUE (V.O.) 
 Helm’s Deep has one weakness. Its outer 
 wall is solid rock but for a small 
 culvert at its base which is little more 
 than a drain.

INT. ORTHANC ANTE-CHAMBER - DAY 
 
CLOSE ON: SARUMAN pours gunpowder into a LARGE STONE POT.

ANGLE ON: WORMTONGUE leans over the pot, holding a 
candle...SARUMAN reaches out his hand to stay the candle’s 
approach...SARUMAN pushes WORMTONGUE away from the pot. 
 
   SARUMAN 
 If the wall is breached, Helm's Deep will 
 fall.  
 
SARUMAN walks through ORTHANC...WORMTONGUE follows closely. 
 
   WORMTONGUE 
 Even if it is breached, it would take a 
 number beyond reckoning, thousands, to 
 storm the keep. 
 
SARUMAN approaches his balcony, which overlooks ISENGARD. 
 
   SARUMAN 
 Tens of thousands. 
 
   WORMTONGUE 
 But, my lord, there is no such force. 
 
TRACK WITH: SARUMAN and WORMTONGUE walk onto the balcony as a 
HORN sounds. 
 
HIGH WIDE ON: SARUMAN’S TENS OF THOUSANDS of URUK-HAI stand

columns.

   SARUMAN (CONT’D) 
 March to Helms Deep! Leave none alive!

MERRY reacts to the mention of the name. 
 
   MERRY 
 Isengard? 
 
MERRY climbs up TREEBEARD for a better view. 
 
   TREEBEARD 
 There was a time when Saruman would  
 walk in my woods.  
 
PIPPIN sees MERRY climbing, so he climbs too. TREEBEARD pays  
them little mind. 
 
   TREEBEARD (CONT’D) 
 But now he has a mind of metal and 
 wheels. He no longer cares for growing 
 things. 
 
ANGLE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN reach the upper branches of 
TREEBEARD, just above the tops of the trees. 
 
   PIPPIN 
 What is it?

HAI army marches.

 Brego.

ARWEN looks at him impassively. 
 
   ARWEN 
 I have made my choice. 
 
ELROND approaches her. 
 
   ELROND 
 He is not coming back. Why do you  
 linger here when there is no hope? 
 
   ARWEN 
 There is still hope. 
 
ELROND walks toward the window and looks away from her. 
 
   ELROND 
 If Aragorn survives this war, you will 
 still be parted. If Sauron is defeated 
 and Aragorn made king and all that you 
 hope for comes true, you will still have 
 to taste the bitterness of mortality. 
 Whether by the sword or the slow decay of 
 time, Aragorn will die.  
 
INSERT IMAGE: ARAGORN lies in state holding ANDÚRIL in the 
COURTYARD OF THE KINGS at MINAS TIRITH. His hair is greyed  
many years. ARWEN stands over him mourning his passing. A line

 And there will be no comfort for you, no 
 comfort to ease the pain of his passing.  
 
CROSS-FADE TO: A STONE MONUMENT of ARAGORN lying on the TABLE.

   ELROND (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
 He will come to death, an image of  
 the splendor of the kings of Men in  
 glory undimmed before the breaking of  
 the world.  
 But you, my daughter, you will linger on 
 in darkness and in doubt as nightfall in 
 winter that comes without a star.

 your life are utterly spent.

 Arwen...

love for her father. 
 
   ELROND (CONT’D) 
 There is nothing for you here, only 
 death.

 One we lost in Moria, two were my kin, a 
 Dwarf there was also, and an Elf. And two 
 Men, Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and 
 Boromir of Gondor. 
 
FARAMIR’S expression changes to that of reserved surprise.

 You’re a friend of Boromir?

 Yes... for my part.

BOROMIR turns. 
 
ANGLE ON: LORD DENETHOR, their father and the STEWARD OF  
GONDOR, makes his way through the crowd, happily greeting the 
people. 
 
ANGLE ON: BOROMIR, turns away in frustration. 
 
   BOROMIR (CONT’D) 
 One moment of peace, can he not give  
 us that? 
 
   DENETHOR 
  (smiling broadly) 
 Where is he? Where is Gondor’s finest? 
 Where’s my first-born? 
 
BOROMIR musters a smile, and then turns to greet DENETHOR. 
 
   BOROMIR 
 Father! 
 
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR drops back, as if staying out of the way... 
BOROMIR embraces DENETHOR. 
 
   DENETHOR 
 They say you vanquished the enemy  
 almost single-handedly. 
 
   BOROMIR 
 They exaggerate. The victory belongs 
 to Faramir also. 
 
FARAMIR smiles and steps forward...DENETHOR scowls. 
 
   DENETHOR 
  (condescending) 
 But for Faramir, this city would still  
 be standing. Were you not entrusted to  
 protect it? 
  
   FARAMIR 
 I would have done, but our numbers 
 were too few. 
      (CONTINUED) 
149. 
 
CONTINUED: (3) 
 
   DENETHOR 
 Oh, too few. You let the enemy walk in 
 and take it on a whim. 
 
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR is shattered, hurt by his father’s 
condescension. DENETHOR steps toward him for the kill. 
 
   DENETHOR (CONT’D) 
 Always you cast a poor reflection on 
 me. 
 
   FARAMIR 
 That is not my intent. 
 
   BOROMIR 
  (impatient) 
 You give him no credit, and yet he 
 tries do to your will. 
 
ANGLE ON: BOROMIR storms away. DENETHOR leaves FARAMIR and 
follows him. 
 
   BOROMIR (CONT’D) 
 He loves you, Father. 
 
   DENETHOR 
 Do not trouble me with Faramir ... I 
 know his uses, and they are few. 
 
ANGLE ON: BOROMIR turns away, unbelieving a father would say 
such things of a son. 
 
   DENETHOR (CONT’D) 
 We have more urgent things to speak  
 of. Elrond of Rivendell has called 
 a meeting. He will not say why, but 
 I have guessed its purpose. It is  
 rumored that the weapon of the enemy 
 has been found.  
 
CLOSE ON: BOROMIR’S mouth DROPS in SURPRISE and DISBELIEF. 
 
   BOROMIR 
  (delicately) 
 The One Ring ... Isildur’s Bane. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
150. 
 
CONTINUED: (4) 
 
   DENETHOR 
 It has fallen into the hands of the  
 Elves. Everyone will try to claim it:  
 Men, Dwarves, wizards. We cannot let  
 that happen. This thing must come to  
 Gondor. 
 
   BOROMIR 
 Gondor. 
 
   DENETHOR 
 It’s dangerous, I know. Ever the Ring  
 will seek to corrupt the hearts of  
 lesser Men. But you, you are strong...  
 and our need is great. It is our blood  
 which is being spilled, our people who  
 are dying. Sauron is biding his time.  
 He’s massing fresh armies. He will  
 return. And when he does, we will be 
 powerless to stop him. You must go.  
 Bring me back this mighty gift. 
 
ANGLE ON: BOROMIR pulls away from DENETHOR and proceeds back  
out into OSGILIATH. 
 
   BOROMIR 
 No. My place is here with my people. 
 Not in Rivendell 
 
ANGLE ON: DENETHOR chases BOROMIR out. 
 
   DENETHOR 
 Would you deny your own father? 
 
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR steps forward. 
 
   FARAMIR 
 If there is a need to go to Rivendell, 
 send me in his stead. 
 
ANGLE ON: DENETHOR looks at FARAMIR with a cruel sneer. 
 
   DENETHOR 
 You? Oh, I see. A chance for Faramir, 
 captain of Gondor, to show his  
 quality. I think not. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
151. 
 
CONTINUED: (5) 
 
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR’S confident expression drops. 
 
   DENETHOR (CONT’D) 
 I trust this mission only to your 
 brother. The one who will not fail me. 
 
ANGLE ON: DENETHOR turns to BOROMIR, who stands against the  
wall looking strangely angered and defeated. 
 
      CUT TO: 
 
EXT. OSGILIATH - DAY 
 
ANGLE ON: BOROMIR sits ready atop his steed, looking as he did 
when we first saw him ride into RIVENDELL. He glances upward. 
 
ANGLE ON: A WHITE FLAG, EMBLAZONED with the IMAGE OF A TREE ...  
the STANDARD OF THE STEWARD OF GONDOR flies high over  
OSGILIATH. 
 
ANGLE ON: BOROMIR turns his gaze to FARAMIR, who looks up at his 
brother. 
 
   BOROMIR 
 Remember today, little brother. 
 
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR smiles and nods...BOROMIR smiles in return  
and trots his horse out of OSGILIATH. 
 
      CUT TO: 
 
INT. HENNETH ANNÛN - NIGHT 
 
FARAMIR sits alone...staring into nothing...lost in his 
memories. MADRIL approaches behind him. 
 
   MADRIL 
 Captain Faramir!  
 
MADRIL leans to FARAMIR’S ear. 
 
   MADRIL (CONT’D) 
  (whispers) 
 We found the third one.

ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM sleep. FRODO’S eyes slowly open as 
footsteps approach. He looks up at figures before him. 
 
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR stands before him with 2 other GONDORIAN 
RANGERS. 
 
   FARAMIR 
 You must come with me. Now.  
 
FRODO silently rises and follows them. 
 
EXT. HENNETH ANNÛN - NIGHT 
 
WIDE ON: The Waterfall concealing their location flows over the 
cliff leaving space on the sides. FARAMIR inches toward the 
edge. 
 
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR gestures to FRODO. 
 
   FARAMIR (CONT’D) 
 Down there. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO carefully walks to the edge and looks down. 
FARAMIR eyes him watchfully. 
 
ANGLE ON: Far below, GOLLUM jumps into the pool at the base of 
the waterfall. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO’S eyes open wide, as if caught in his lie. 
 
   FARAMIR (CONT’D) 
  (calmly) 
 To enter the Forbidden Pool bears 
 the penalty of death.  
 
FRODO looks at FARAMIR with fear. FARAMIR gestures to the sides 
of the waterfall...ARCHERS stationed on both sides of the pool 
lean in and draw their bows...FRODO looks back to GOLLUM. 
 
   FARAMIR (CONT’D) 
 They wait for my command.  
 
ANGLE ON: Far below, GOLLUM emerges from the pool with a fish in 
his teeth and sits on a rock. 
 
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR still calmly watches FRODO’S reactions. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
153. 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
   FARAMIR (CONT’D) 
 Shall I shoot? 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO is rapt with indecision. 
 
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM sits on the rock with his fish...completely 
oblivious that his life may be in mortal danger. 
 
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR gives a signal to the ARCHERS. They raise 
their bows. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO continues watching GOLLUM, indecision etched 
across his face. 
 
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM attempts to eat the fish, but it wriggles about 
in his grasp. He regains control of the fish and whacks it 
repeatedly on the rock. 
 
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR raises his hand to give the signal to fire. 
 
   FRODO 
 Wait!  
 
FARAMIR stops. He continues looking at FRODO expectantly. 
 
   FRODO (CONT’D) 
  (with difficulty) 
 This creature is bound to me. And I to 
 him.  
 
FARAMIR lowers his hand and responds, knowing GOLLUM is  
connected to FRODO. 
 
   FRODO (CONT’D) 
 He is our guide.  
  (desperately) 
 Please ... let me go down to him.  
 
FARAMIR nods. FRODO runs off. 
 
EXT. THE FORBIDDEN POOL - NIGHT 
 
GOLLUM tears at the fish. FRODO appears from behind him. 
 
   FRODO (CONT’D) 
 Sméagol! 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
154. 
 
CONTINUED:  
 
GOLLUM continues eating, not responding to FRODO’S call. 
 
   FRODO (CONT’D) 
 Master is here.  
 
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM turns to FRODO, hesitantly. 
 
   FRODO (CONT’D) 
 Come, Sméagol. Trust master. Come!  
 
GOLLUM doesn’t move. He looks at FRODO distrustfully. 
 
   GOLLUM 
 We must go now? 
 
   FRODO 
 Sméagol, you must trust master. Follow 
 me, come on. Come.  
 
GOLLUM finally responds to FRODO. He puts the fish between his 
teeth and follows warily after FRODO. 
 
   FRODO (CONT’D) 
 Come Sméagol. Nice Sméagol. That’s it. 
 Come on. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO stops. GOLLUM’S eyes dart around, fearfully. 
 
SUDDENLY! A GONDORIAN RANGER grabs GOLLUM by the neck, lifting 
him off the ground. Instantly, several others descend on him, 
quickly overpowering him. GOLLUM wails in anguish. 
 
   FRODO (CONT’D) 
 Don’t hurt him! Sméagol don’t 
 struggle! Sméagol listen to me! 
 
   GOLLUM 
 Master! 
 
A BLACK CLOTH is draped over GOLLUM’S head. The RANGERS pack  
him back into HENNETH ANNÛN...FRODO looks up to FARAMIR, 
speechless. 
 
155. 
 
INT. HENNETH ANNÛN - NIGHT 
 
CLOSE ON: GOLLUM is slung against a wall of the cave. He wails 
in agony. 
 
ANGLES ON: FARAMIR’S MEN throw GOLLUM to the ground, beating and 
kicking him. GOLLUM is helpless against their strength. 
 
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR watches out into the night. Finally, he turns 
to them. 
 
   FARAMIR 
 That’s enough. 
 
ANGLE ON: The MEN throw GOLLUM to the ground. He scrambles into 
a corner. FARAMIR approaches him. 
 
   FARAMIR (CONT’D) 
 Where are you leading them?  
 
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM cowers away from him, whimpering. 
 
   FARAMIR (CONT’D) 
 Answer me! 
 
GOLLUM continues sobbing. Suddenly, his hand starts stroking his 
shoulder, comfortingly. 
 
   GOLLUM 
 Sméagol. Why does it cry, Sméagol? 
 
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR looks upon GOLLUM, confused. 
 
   SMÉAGOL 
  (sobbing)  
 Cruel Men hurts us. Master tricksed us. 
 
   GOLLUM 
 Of course he did.  
 
SMÉAGOL sobs again. 
 
   GOLLUM 
 I told you he was tricksy. I told you he 
 was false. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
156. 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
   SMÉAGOL 
  (sobbing)  
 Master is our friend ... our friend. 
 
   GOLLUM 
 Master betrayed us. 
 
   SMÉAGOL 
 No. Not its business. Leave us 
 alone! 
 
GOLLUM hits his fist against the wall. 
 
   GOLLUM 
 Filthy little Hobbitses. They stole 
 it from us! 
 
   SMÉAGOL 
  (whimpers)  
 No ... No. 
 
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR, suddenly interested. 
 
   FARAMIR 
 What did they steal? 
 
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM turns to FARAMIR with a fearsome expression. 
 
   GOLLUM 
 My Precious!  
 
He bares his teeth and growls.

INT. HENNETH ANNÛN - NIGHT 
 
ANGLE ON: SAM and FRODO sit alone in a storage area. 
 
   SAM

 We have to get out of here. You go. 
 Go, now.  
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO looks to SAM, warily. SAM crawls over to him. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
157. 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
   SAM (CONT’D) 
  (whispers) 
 You can do it. Use the Ring, Mr. Frodo. 
 Just this once. Put it on. Disappear. 
 
FRODO shakes his head. 
 
   FRODO 
  (with difficulty) 
 I can’t. You were right, Sam. You tried 
 to tell me but ... I’m sorry. The Ring’s 
 taking me, Sam.  
  (fearfully) 
 If I put it on, he’ll find me. He’ll 
 see. 
 
   SAM 
 Mr. Frodo... 
 
SAM suddenly looks up. 
 
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR enters and draws his sword. The HOBBITS jump  
up and stand before him. 
 
   FARAMIR 
 So this is the answer to all the riddles 
 ... here in the Wild I have you. Two 
 halflings ... and a host of Men at my 
 call.  
 
FARAMIR backs FRODO up against a wall, his sword at FRODO’S  
neck. 
 
   FARAMIR (CONT’D) 
 The Ring of Power within my grasp.  
 
CLOSE ON: FARAMIR lifts the RING from FRODO'S tunic with the tip 
of his sword. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO looks at FARAMIR with fear. 
 
   FARAMIR (CONT’D) 
 A chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor, 
 to show his quality.  
 
CLOSE ON: The RING remains on FRODO’S chest at the tip of 
FARAMIR’S sword.

ON THE SOUNDTRACK: The HUM of the RING grows louder. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO reacts to the RING’S call to FARAMIR.  
 
SUDDENLY! FRODO breaks from his trance and throws FARAMIR’S  
sword from him. 
 
   FRODO 
 No!!  
 
FRODO runs into a corner and cowers there with the RING. 
 
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR watches FRODO’S reaction with surprise...SAM 
reels on FARAMIR. 
 
   SAM 
  (angrily) 
 Stop it! Leave him alone! Don’t you 
 understand? He’s got to destroy it! 
 That’s where we’re going ... into 
 Mordor ... to the mountain of fire. 
 
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR, unmoving, continues to stare at FRODO. MADRIL 
enters behind him, snapping him out of his trance. 
 
   MADRIL 
 Osgiliath is under attack. They call for 
 reinforcements. 
 
   SAM 
 Please. It’s such a burden. Will you not 
 help him? 
 
   MADRIL 
 Captain? 
 
   FARAMIR 
  (to Madril) 
 Prepare to leave.  
 
FARAMIR turns back to SAM and FRODO, expressionless. 
 
   FARAMIR (CONT’D) 
 The Ring will go to Gondor.  
 
SAM’S face turns to fear and hopelessness.

EXT. PLAINS OF ROHAN - DAY 
 
ARAGORN rides atop BREGO. He stops on a ridge overlooking the 
PLAINS. 
 
CLOSE ON: ARAGORN looks across the PLAINS, worried. 
 
ANGLE ON: Still far off in the distance, the massive URUK-HAI 
ARMY marches in files towards HELM’S DEEP. The black lines of 
troops stretches beyond eyesight. 
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN, speechless and scared, pulls BREGO back and 
gallops as fast as he can handle to HELM’S DEEP. 
 
EXT. HELM’S DEEP OVERLOOK - DAY 
 
WIDE ON: ARAGORN and BREGO reach the hillock overlooking the 
wide plains before HELM’S DEEP, nestled in the mountain.

   GIMLI 
 Where is he? Where is he? Get out 
 of the way! I’m gonna kill him!  
 
CLOSE ON: GIMLI looks upon ARAGORN in amazement. He smiles 
broadly.

 and the most reckless man I ever 
 knew!

 Gimli, where is the king? 
 
GIMLI nods to the HALL. 
 
INT. HELM’S DEEP HALL - DAY 
 
As ARAGORN walks through the people, he meets LEGOLAS, who 
blocks his path. LEGOLAS looks at him, amused.  
 
   LEGOLAS 
  (in ELVISH; subtitled) 
 Le ab-dollen.  
 
 You’re late. 
 
They smiles. LEGOLAS gives ARAGORN a once-over and frowns. 
 
   LEGOLAS (CONT’D) 
 You look terrible.  
 
ARAGORN laughs. 
 
ANGLE ON: ÉOWYN tends to one of the people. She turns and is 
overjoyed to see ARAGORN returned. She moves to him, but pauses.

   THÉODEN 
 A great host, you say?  
 
   ARAGORN 
 All Isengard is emptied  
 
   THÉODEN 
 How many? 
 
   ARAGORN 
 Ten thousand strong at least.  
 
THÉODEN turns to ARAGORN, incredulous. 
 
   THÉODEN 
  (in disbelief) 
 Ten thousand? 
 
   ARAGORN 
  (grim) 
 It is an army bred for a single 
 purpose ... to destroy the world of 
 Men.  
 
CLOSE ON: THÉODEN attempts to fathom ARAGORN’S bombshell. He 
shows real fear. 
 
CLOSE ON: ARAGORN grimly completes the bad news. 
 
   ARAGORN (CONT’D) 
 They will be here by nightfall.

 I want every man and strong lad able to 
 bear arms to be ready for battle by 
 nightfall.  
 
He dismisses GAMLING. He, ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI continue 
on to stand just outside the main gate. 
 
WIDE ON: THÉODEN stands outside the gate on the stone pathway 
leading into HELM’S DEEP. He addresses his plan. 
 
   THÉODEN (CONT’D) 
 We will cover the causeway and the gate 
 from above. No army has ever breached 
 the Deeping Wall or set foot inside the 
 Hornburg!  
 
GIMLI stands bored against the gate. 
 
   GIMLI 
 This is no rabble of mindless Orcs. 
 
THÉODEN turns to GIMLI, almost surprised to hear from him. 
 
   GIMLI (CONT’D) 
  These are Uruk-Hai. Their armor is thick 
 and their shields broad.  
 
THÉODEN stands tall before GIMLI. 
 
   THÉODEN 
 I have fought many wars, Master Dwarf.  
 I know how to defend my own Keep.  
 
THÉODEN walks back into the KEEP.

WIDE ON: THÉODEN leads ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI across the 
battlements of HELM’S DEEP, overlooking the expansive plains. 
 
   THÉODEN (CONT’D) 
 They will break upon this fortress 
 like water on rock. Saruman’s hordes 
 will pillage and burn. We’ve seen it 
 before. Crops can be resown; homes 
 rebuilt. Within these walls, we will 
 outlast them. 
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN follows THÉODEN closely. 
 
   ARAGORN 
 They do not come to destroy Rohan’s 
 crops or villages. They come to 
 destroy its people ... down to the 
 last child.  
 
ANGLE ON: THÉODEN turns quickly to ARAGORN and draws him close. 
 
   THÉODEN 
  (quietly; angrily) 
 What would you have me do? Look at my 
 Men. Their courage hangs by a thread.  
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN looks away ashamed. 
 
   THÉODEN (CONT’D) 
 If this is to be our end, then I would 
 have them make such an end as to be 
 worthy of remembrance.  
 
THÉODEN walks away. ARAGORN pleads with THÉODEN. 
 
   ARAGORN 
 Send out riders, my lord. You must 
 call for aid. 
 
THÉODEN turns back ARAGORN, drawing close again. 
 
   THÉODEN 
  (doubtfully) 
 And who will come? Elves? Dwarves? 
 We are not so lucky in our friends 
 as you. The old alliances are dead.

 Gondor?! Where was Gondor when the 
 Westfold fell? Where was Gondor when  
 our enemies closed in around us?! Where 
 was Gon--? 
 
THÉODEN recollects himself. He looks into ARAGORN’S eyes. 
 
   THÉODEN (CONT’D) 
  (quietly) 
 No, my Lord Aragorn...we are alone.  
 
ANGLE ON: THÉODEN turns away again...ARAGORN looks after him, 
nodding...THÉODEN walks up the steps to the HALL, followed 
closely by GAMLING. 
 
   THÉODEN (CONT’D) 
 Get the women and children into the 
 caves.  
 
   GAMLING 
 We need more time to lay provisions--  
 
   THÉODEN 
  (curt) 
 There is no time. War is upon us. 
 
THÉODEN and STAFF enter into the HALL...HIGH OVERHEAD, a flock  
of crows gathers.

TREEBEARD continues his walk through FANGORN. MERRY and PIPPIN

 What’s that? 
 
   TREEBEARD 
 'Tis a gathering. 
 
   MERRY 
 A gathering of what?  
 
A noise sounds from behind them.

ANGLES ON: ENTS begin emerging from the forest and walking 
towards TREEBEARD. 
 
OVERHEAD ANGLE ON: Many ENTS walk to the middle of the gathering 
where TREEBEARD awaits. 
 
   TREEBEARD 
 Beech. Oak. Chestnut. Ash. Good. Good. 
 Good. Many have come.  
 
ANGLES ON: The ENTS all stop near TREEBEARD...MERRY and PIPPIN 
look about in awe. 
 
   TREEBEARD (CONT’D) 
 Now we must decide if the Ents will 
 go to war.

anticipation. 
 
EXT. HELM’S DEEP COURTYARD - DAY

the plan to LEGOLAS.

   ARAGORN 
 We’ll place the reserves along the wall.  
 They can support the archers from above  
 the gate.  
 
   LEGOLAS 
 Aragorn, you must rest. You’re no use  
 to us half alive. 
 
ARAGORN pays LEGOLAS no mind. A VOICE breaks across the  
throngs. ARAGORN looks in its direction. 
 
   ÉOWYN (O.S.) 
 Aragorn! Aragorn! 
 
ANGLE ON: ÉOWYN runs through the crowds towards him. She looks 
at him angrily. 
 
   ÉOWYN (CONT’D) 
 I’m to be sent with the women into 
 the caves. 
 
   ARAGORN 
  (nodding) 
 That is an honorable charge. 
 
   ÉOWYN 
 To mind the children, to find food and 
 bedding with the men return. What 
 renown is there in that? 
 
ARAGORN grasps her hands. 
 
   ARAGORN 
  (reassuring) 
 My lady, a time may come for valor 
 without renown. Who then will your 
 people look to in the last defense? 
 
   ÉOWYN 
  (pleading) 
 Let me stand at your side. 
 
   ARAGORN 
 It is not in my power to command it.

CONTINUED: (2) 
 
ARAGORN turns away from her. She looks after him unmoved. He 
turns. 
 
   ÉOWYN 
 You do not command the others to stay! 
 They fight beside you because they  
 would not be parted from you. 
  (desperately) 
 Because they love you! 
 
ARAGORN stands before her, looking at her silently. She averts 
her gaze. 
 
   ÉOWYN (CONT’D) 
 I’m sorry. 
 
She pushes past him and follows the people into the caves.

their way into the caves...They regard their new home with fear

discouraged. 
 
   ARAGORN 
 Farmer, farriers, stable boys. These are 
 no soldiers.  
 
   GIMLI 
 Most have seen too many winters.  
 
   LEGOLAS 
 Or too few.

turns away, angrily. 
 
   LEGOLAS (CONT’D)

 And they should be...Three hundred 
 ...against ten thousand! 
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN looks at LEGOLAS with as much confidence as he 
can muster.

  (in ELVISH; subtitled) 
 Si beriathar hýn. Amar nâ ned Edoras.  
  (subtitled) 
 They have more hope of defending 
 themselves here than at Edoras. 
 
   LEGOLAS 
 Aragorn, Men i ndagor. Hýn ú-... 
 ortheri. Natha daged aen!  
 
 Aragorn, we are warriors. They 
 cannot win this fight. They are all 
 going to die! 
 
ARAGORN explodes at LEGOLAS. 
 
   ARAGORN 
  (resolute) 
 Then I shall die as one them!  
 
Their gaze locks for a moment...ARAGORN breaks and walks away. 
LEGOLAS makes to follow him...GIMLI puts a hand on his arm. 
 
   GIMLI 
 Let him go, lad. Let him be.

 My lord?

PIPPIN stands and walks over to him. 
 
   PIPPIN 
 They must have decided something by 
 now. 
 
TREEBEARD turns to them and shakes his head. 
 
   TREEBEARD 
 Decided? No. 
 
Slowly, TREEBEARD turns to the HOBBITS. 
 
   TREEBEARD (CONT’D) 
 We only just finished saying...good 
 morning.

 But it’s nighttime already. You can’t  
 take forever. 
 
ANGLE ON: TREEBEARD slowly turns to MERRY again.

gaze. 
 
   ARAGORN 
 Give me your sword.

walks over to ARAGORN and hands over his sword. ARAGORN takes  
it. 
 
   ARAGORN (CONT’D) 
 What is your name? 
 
   HALETH 
 Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.  
 
ARAGORN reacts to the name. 
 
   HALETH (CONT’D) 
 The Men are saying that we will not 
 live out the night. They say that it is 
 hopeless... 
 
Wordlessly, ARAGORN stands and eyeballs the sword. He gives it a 
few swings and holds it before him. He looks at HALETH. 
 
   ARAGORN 
 This is a good sword.  
 
ARAGORN hands the sword back to HALETH, who takes it gingerly. 
 
   ARAGORN (CONT’D) 
 Haleth, son of Háma... 
 
ARAGORN leans down to him.

 not led us astray. Forgive me. I was 
 wrong to despair. 
 
ARAGORN shakes his head.

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN and LEGOLAS smile...GIMLI is unphased. 
 
   GIMLI (CONT’D)

respect.  
 
   THÉODEN

 An alliance once existed between Elves 
 and Men. Long ago we fought and died 
 together.  
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI appear at the head of the

   TREEBEARD 
 This is not our war.  
 
   MERRY 
 But you're part of this world!  
 
ANGLE ON: TREEBEARD stands up uncomfortably. MERRY looks to the 
other ENTS. 
 
   MERRY (CONT’D) 
 Aren’t you?! 
 
ANGLE ON: The ENTS looks at each other, surprised at this 
outburst. 
 
   MERRY (CONT’D) 
  (desperately) 
 You must help. Please. You must do 
 something.  
 
   TREEBEARD 
  (simply) 
 You are young and brave, Master Merry. 
 But your part in this tale is over. Go 
 back to your home.  
 
CLOSE ON: MERRY stands speechless ... angry ... frustrated. 
 
LATER... 
 
MERRY is putting on his jacket. PIPPIN approaches him slowly. 
 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
186. 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
   PIPPIN 
 Maybe Treebeard’s right. We don’t 
 belong here, Merry. It's too big for  
 us. What can we do in the end? We've  
 got the Shire. Maybe we should go  
 home.  
 
   MERRY 
  (distantly)  
 The fires of Isengard will spread 
 And the woods of Tuckborough and 
 Buckland will burn. And... 
 
MERRY turns to PIPPIN. 
 
   MERRY (CONT’D) 
  (angrily) 
 ...and all that was once green and 
 good in this world will be gone.  
 
MERRY looks into PIPPIN’S eyes intently. 
 
   MERRY (CONT’D) 
 There won't be a Shire, Pippin.  
 
CLOSE ON: PIPPIN stands silently, taking this in.

glances up to the WALL. 
 
   ARAGORN (CONT’D) 
 Haldir!  
 
ANGLE ON: HALDIR turns to him. 
 
   ARAGORN (CONT’D) 
  (in ELVISH; subtitled) 
 Na barad! 
 
 To the Keep! 
 
HALDIR nods and starts fighting his way down. 
 
ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS and another ELF carry GIMLI off the FIELD, 
kicking and struggling. 
 
   GIMLI 
  (protesting)  
 What are you doing? What are you  
 stopping for? 
 
ANGLE ON: HALDIR gives orders to his retreating detachment. 
 
   HALDIR 
  (in ELVISH) 
 Na barad! 
 
He turns and starts to retreat, but he is stopped by an URUK-HAI 
who leaps in front of him. He makes short work of this one, but 
another comes from behind him and stabs him in the arm. 
 
SLOW MOTION: HALDIR staggers...he kills the offending URUK...he 
looks down to his arm in total disbelief...he whirls around, 
lost to his purpose... 
 
      (CONTINUED)

HALDIR’S HEAD...HALDIR freezes with a shocked look on his 
face... 
 
SLOW MOTION ANGLE ON: ARAGORN, on the ground, sees HALDIR 
FALLING...HALDIR falls to his knees, his world spinning around 
him...ARAGORN fights his way up the steps...HALDIR looks about 
him...the dead bodies of his kinsmen lie all around him...he 
falls to the ground just as ARAGORN catches him...his head falls 
into ARAGORN’S arm...eyes lifeless and unseeing... 
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN gives HALDIR a silent farewell...seeing a 
group of approaching URUK-HAI, like a madman, ARAGORN leaps 
aboard the nearest ladder and rides it into the sea of URUK-HAI 
below.

THÉODEN and his SOLDIERS work desperately to hold the gate 
against impossible odds. 
 
An URUK starts to get the better of GAMLING, but THÉODEN  
rescues him. Seizing this advantage, another URUK stabs THÉODEN 
in the shoulder with his lance. Wounded but undeterred, THÉODEN 
returns the blow, but more lethally.  
 
He falls into GAMLING’S arms. GAMLING quickly pulls him out of 
the area.

   GAMLING (CONT’D) 
 We cannot hold much longer.

the URUK-HAI. The MEN work fiercely to hold it. 
 
ANGLE ON: THÉODEN looks momentarily discouraged until ARAGORN 
runs through and begins hacking at the URUK-HAI. 
 
   THÉODEN 
  (yelling) 
 Hold them!  
 
   ARAGORN 
 How long do you need?  
 
THÉODEN takes his sword in hand. 
 
   THÉODEN 
 As long as you can give me. 
 
ARAGORN nods and looks around. 
 
   ARAGORN 
 Gimli!  
 
ARAGORN slips out a side exit as the MEN rush the GATE to hold 
it. 
 
EXT. HELM’S DEEP GATE - NIGHT 
 
More URUKS run at the GATE

 Come on. We can take them.  
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN looks at GIMLI sidelong with a smirk. 
 
   ARAGORN 
 It’s a long way.  
 
ANGLE ON: GIMLI takes a peek...he steps back and looks into the 
distance...embarrassed. 
 
   GIMLI 
  (mumbles)  
 Toss me.  
 
   ARAGORN 
 What?  
 
   GIMLI 
  (quickly) 
 I cannot jump the distance. You’ll 
 have to toss me!  
 
ARAGORN nods slowly...he turns to lift GIMLI. 
 
   GIMLI (CONT’D) 
 Oh...don’t tell the Elf.  
 
   ARAGORN 
 Not a word.  
 
ANGLE ON: with one swift move, ARAGORN tosses GIMLI across the 
span and into the throng of URUK-HAI, taking them by complete 
surprise. 
 
ARAGORN jumps the distance himself and fight alongside GIMLI.

the inside of the WALL. 
 
ANGLE ON: The URUKS fire another. 
 
ANGLE ON: The HOOK grapples to the inside of the WALL. The 
SOLDIERS try in vain to dislodge it. 
 
ANGLE ON: The URUK-HAI use the hooks as pulleys to pull great 
SIEGE LADDERS laden with URUK-HAI to the UPPER BATTLEMENTS. The 
LADDERS hook themselves on contact, and the URUK-HAI make to 
continue the fight. 
 
INT. HELM’S DEEP GATE - NIGHT

 Pull everybody back! Pull them 
 back!  
 
   GAMLING 
 Pull back! Pull back!  
 
EXT. HELM’S DEEP BATTLEMENTS - NIGHT 
 
HIGH WIDE ON: A hopeless stream of URUK-HAI stream up the 
LADDERS...press against the outer wall...charge the main 
gate...the scant supply of SOLDIERS fire arrows fruitlessly 
against them. 
 
THE URUK-HAI BREAK THROUGH THE GATE AND POUR IN.

the retreat...

EXT. FANGORN FOREST - NIGHT 
 
TREEBEARD walks lazily through the forest, carrying MERRY and 
PIPPIN in his branches. 
 
   TREEBEARD 
 I will leave you at the western 
 borders of the forest. You can make 
 your way north to your homeland from 
 there. 
 
MERRY and PIPPIN do not respond. They look dejected. 
 
SUDDENLY, PIPPIN looks up with a gleam in his eye. 
 
   PIPPIN 
 Wait! Stop! Stop!  
 
ANGLE ON: MERRY looks over to PIPPIN, curious. TREEBEARD stops. 
 
   PIPPIN (CONT’D) 
 Turn around. Turn around. Take us south!  
 
TREEBEARD looks to him, perturbed. 
 
   TREEBEARD 
 South? But that will lead you past 
 Isengard.  
 
PIPPIN smiles. 
 
   PIPPIN 
 Yes. Exactly. If we go south we can 
  slip past Saruman unnoticed. The 
  closer we are to danger, the farther we 
 are from harm. It’s the last thing he’ll 
 expect.  
      (CONTINUED) 
194. 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
MERRY looks away, confused. TREEBEARD ponders this for a  
moment. 
 
   TREEBEARD 
 That doesn’t make sense to me. But  
 then, you are very small. Perhaps you’re 
 right.  
 
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN breathes a sigh of relief and smiles. 
 
   TREEBEARD (CONT’D) 
 South it is then. Hold on, little 
 Shirelings.  
 
ANGLE ON: TREEBEARD begins his slow plod through the forest 
again...MERRY looks over the PIPPIN, incredulous.

 Are you mad? We’ll be caught.

 No we won’t. Not this time.

FARAMIR and COMPANY, with FRODO and SAM in tow, come to the top 
of a ridge and stop. 
 
WIDE ON: OSGILIATH, positioned astride the ANDUIN RIVER, stands

distance-nestled in the mountains-is MINAS TIRITH.

 Osgiliath burns!  
 
   RANGER 
 Mordor has come. 
 
The RANGERS walk down to OSGILIATH. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO stands before FARAMIR, observing. 
 
   FRODO

 only the power to destroy. Please...  
 let me go. 
      (CONTINUED)

ANGLE ON: FARAMIR hesitates, lost in indecision...then he 
gestures to his men.

 Faramir! You must let me go!

EXT. FANGORN FOREST - DAY 
 
TREEBEARD plods along with MERRY and PIPPIN riding in his 
branches. 
 
   TREEBEARD 
 And a little family of field mice that 
 climb up sometimes, and they tickle me 
 awfully. They’re always trying to get 
 somewhere where they...  
 
ANGLE ON: TREEBEARD’S expression drops...his eyes grow wide... 
he stops in speechless horror. 
 
WIDE ON: The edge of the FOREST is utterly destroyed...burnt 
stumps and mangled bits of trees are all that remains... 
 
   TREEBEARD (CONT’D) 
  (choked) 
 Many of these trees were my friends. 
 Creatures I had known from nut and 
 acorn.  
 
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN looks down at TREEBEARD with pity. 
 
   PIPPIN 
 I’m sorry, Treebeard.  
 
   TREEBEARD 
 They had voices of their own.  
 
      (CONTINUED) 
196.

as well with smoking caverns. 
 
   TREEBEARD (CONT’D) 
 Saruman.  
 
ANGLE ON: TREEBEARD shakes in fury. 
 
   TREEBEARD (CONT’D) 
  (angrily) 
 A wizard should know better!  
 
WIDE ON: TREEBEARD stands amidst the desolation and emits a 
furious roar. 
 
   TREEBEARD (CONT’D) 
 There is no curse in Elvish, Entish or 
 the tongues of Men for this treachery.  
 
A SOUND emits from the FOREST behind them. 
 
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN whips around...his eyes grow wide. 
 
   PIPPIN 
 Look! The trees! They’re moving!

 Where are they going?

   TREEBEARD 
 Come my friends. The Ents are going to 
 war. It is likely that we go to our 
 doom. Last march of the Ents!  
 
WIDE ON: The ENTS march behind TREEBEARD through the ruined 
portion of FANGORN down the long slope to ISENGARD. 
 
EXT. OSGILIATH - DAY 
 
FARAMIR and his RANGERS lead FRODO, SAM, and GOLLUM into

ANGLE ON: FARAMIR and his RANGERS cut through a battle zone, 
ducking friendly arrows as the city is being defended...FARAMIR 
approaches one of his OFFICERS.

 shore. Their numbers are too great. By 
 nightfall we will be overrun.  
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO seems suddenly stricken. SAM looks to him. 
 
   SAM 
 Frodo!  
 
   FRODO 
 It’s calling to him, Sam. His Eye is 
 almost on me.

 Hold on, Mr. Frodo. You'll be 
 all right.

   FARAMIR (CONT’D) 
  (proudly) 
 Tell him Faramir sends a mighty gift. A 
 weapon that will change our fortunes in 
 this war.  
 
ANGLE ON: SAM breaks their grip a moment. 
 
   SAM 
  (desperately) 
 You want to know what happened to 
 Boromir?  
 
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR turns to SAM. He looks upon the little HOBBIT 
with intense curiosity. 
 
   SAM (CONT’D) 
 You want to know why your brother died? 
 He tried to take the Ring from Frodo! 
 After swearing an oath to protect him, 
 he tried to kill him! The Ring drove 
 your brother mad!  
 
Before FARAMIR can respond, a cry screams across the silence. 
 
   RANGER 
 Watch out!  
 
LOW ANGLE ON: A large boulder smashes into a tower, crumbling  
it.

ANGLE ON: ARAGORN runs to THÉODEN. LEGOLAS carries more 
furniture to the door.

 You said this fortress would never 
 fall while your Men defend it. They 
 still defend it. They have died 
 defending it.  
 
ANOTHER DEAFENING CRUNCH! 
 
INTERCUT WITH: The women and children in the GLITTERING CAVES 
panic....they cling to each other...ÉOWYN gives comfort where  
she can.

   ARAGORN (CONT’D) 
 Is there no other way for the women 
 and children to get out of the 
 caves?

   ARAGORN (CONT’D) 
 Is there no other way?  
 
   GAMLING 
 There is one passage. It leads into

 far. The Uruk-Hai are too many.

new threat. They ready their lances before them.

line, the sun emerges from behind the ridge and momentarily 
blinds the URUK-HAI, giving the ROHIRRIM first strike to overrun 
them.

URUK-HAI, quickly decimating their numbers.

ANGLE ON: TREEBEARD braces himself. 
 
   TREEBEARD 
 Hold on little Hobbits! 
 
WIDE ON: The water hits the ENTS full force, but they are 
unmoved...the water flushes the running ORCS and their 
constructs over the edge of the ISENGARD caverns... 
 
ANGLE ON: ORCS working in the depths of the caverns. 
 
PAN UP TO: Water floods in on top of them... 
 
ANGLES ON: The ORCS in the CAVERNS run hopelessly from the 
flood...the water destroys their bridges...forges...

and washing it into the caverns...only the ENTS escape  
untouched. 
 
EXT. OSGILIATH - DAY 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO, in some kind of trance, walks slowly away  
from the safe corner. SAM tries to speak to him as he passes.

 What are you doing?  
 
FRODO pays him no attention. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
206. 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
ANGLE ON: THE NAZGÛL on his FELLBEAST flies over the city, 
looking for his prey...FRODO walks out of the tower of safety

the door of the tower, panicked. 
 
   SAM (CONT’D) 
 Where are you going?!

FELLBEAST...the FELLBEAST screams and flies away.

top of SAM, pinning him to the ground. 
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO draws STING and holds it at SAM’S neck...anger 
and distrust etched on his face. 
 
ANGLE ON: SAM looks at the blade with fear...tears runs down his 
face.

 It’s me. It’s your Sam. Don’t you 
 know your Sam?

backs away from SAM and slumps against a wall...STING CLATTERS  
to the ground. 
 
ANGLE ON: SAM touches his neck lightly and pulls himself up. He 
looks at FRODO...FRODO stares at the ground and shakes his head 
in shock. 
 
   FRODO 
  (slowly) 
 I can’t do this, Sam.  
 
   SAM 
  (sadly)  
 I know. It’s all wrong. By rights we 
 shouldn’t even be here.  
 
SAM stumbles to his feet and leans against a wall. 
 
   SAM (CONT’D) 
 But we are.  
 
WIDE ON: Over the ruined OSGILIATH, the FELLBEAST continues to 
circle. 
 
ANGLE ON: SAM keeps watching the terrible scene, and speaks 
absently. 
  
   SAM (CONT’D) 
 It’s like in the great stories, Mr. 
 Frodo. The ones that really mattered. 
 Full of darkness and danger they were.  
 And sometimes you didn’t want to know 
 the end. Because how could the end be 
 happy?  
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO panting against the wall. 
 
EXT. HELM’S DEEP - DAY 
 
The ROHIRRIM decimate the retreating URUK-HAI. 
 
   SAM (V.O.) (CONT’D)

 But in the end, it’s only a passing 
 thing, this shadow.

EXT. ISENGARD - DAY 
 
WIDE ON: The waters continue flowing over ISENGARD destroying 
all the evil that grew there...the ENTS chase the ORCS into the 
pits... 
 
   SAM (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
 Even darkness must pass. A new day 
 will come.  
 
ANGLE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN watch the goings-on with wonder 
riding atop TREEBEARD. 
 
   SAM (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
 And when the sun shines it will shine  
 out the clearer.  
 
ANGLE ON: The ENTS stands tall in the flowing water. 
 
   SAM (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
 Those were the stories that stayed  
 with you... 
 
ANGLE ON: SARUMAN, trapped in ORTHANC...slowly, he backs away 
from the edge of his balcony, and closes the doors to ORTHANC. 
 
   SAM (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
 ...that meant something. Even if you 
 were too small to understand why.  
 
HIGH WIDE ON: The waters completely flood the RING OF 
ISENGARD...to the very edges...wiping out everything SARUMAN  
had done...preparing the land for a renewal. 
 
      (CONTINUED)

 But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. 
 I know now.  
 
EXT. OSGILIATH - DAY 
 
ANGLE ON: SAM stands overlooking OSGILIATH. 
 
   SAM (CONT’D) 
 Folk in those stories had lots of 
 chances of turning back only they 
 didn’t. They kept going because they 
 were holding on to something.  
 
   FRODO 
  (skeptically) 
 What are we holding on to, Sam?  
 
SAM looks at FRODO...SAM walks over and lifts FRODO to his feet. 
 
   SAM 
  (resolute) 
 There’s some good in this world, Mr. 
 Frodo. And it’s worth fighting for.  
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO is moved by SAM’S determination. He smiles 
grimly. 
 
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR approaches them. SAM stiffens at his approach. 
He kneels to their level. 
 
   FARAMIR 
 I think at last we understand one 
 another, Frodo Baggins.  
 
MADRIL APPROACHES FROM BEHIND FARAMIR. FARAMIR stands to face 
him. 
 
   MADRIL 
 You know the laws of our country, 
  the laws of your father. If you let 
 them go, your life will be forfeit.  
 
CLOSE ON: FARAMIR looks at MADRIL, unwavering. 
 
      (CONTINUED)

RANGER’S hand from his shoulder. 
 
EXT. PLAINS OF ROHAN - DAY 
 
WIDE ON: The fleeing URUK-HAI run from HELM’S DEEP over a ridge 
into the PLAINS...standing on the other side of the ridge is a 
large forest. The URUK-HAI run directly for it. 
 
ANGLE ON: THÉODEN, ARAGORN, ÉOMER, and the rest of the ROHIRRIM 
ride to the top of the ridge and stop. 
 
   ÉOMER 
 Stay out of the forest! Keep away from 
 the trees! 
 
ANGLE ON: ÉOMER looks with fear at the forest that has sprung  
up. 
 
ANGLE ON: Inside the forest, the URUK-HAI charge between the 
trunks mindlessly. 
 
WIDE ON: The DEFENDERS OF ROHAN watch silently from atop the 
ridge as the last of the URUK-HAI runs in. Suddenly, the trees 
move. Scream emit from with the forest... 
 
ANGLES ON: the DEFENDERS look on in fear and surprise as the 
forest eliminates the last of their enemies. 
 
EXT. HELM’S DEEP HALL - DAY 
 
ÉOWYN and the other WOMEN and CHILDREN emerge. ARAGORN climbs 
the steps to meet ÉOWYN at their summit. She looks upon him with 
delight and holds him. 
 
EXT. HELM’S DEEP BATTLEMENTS - DAY 
 
SOLDIERS pile the bodies of the dead URUK-HAI. 
 
ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS walks through the carnage and spots GIMLI, 
smoking his pipe. He stops, stroking his bow. 
 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
211. 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
   LEGOLAS 
 Final count...42. 
 
   GIMLI 
  (mock admiration) 
 Forty-two? That’s not bad for a  
 pointy-eared Elvish princeling. I  
 myself am sitting pretty on 43. 
 
ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS’ face drops...suddenly, he fires an arrow at 
the URUK that GIMLI sits upon. 
 
   LEGOLAS 
 Forty-three. 
 
   GIMLI 
 He was already dead. 
 
   LEGOLAS 
 He was twitching. 
 
   GIMLI 
 He was twitching because he’s got my 
 axe buried in his nervous system. 
 
GIMLI demonstrates by working the axe in the URUK’S head. The 
hands and feet twitch as he does. 
 
EXT. ISENGARD - DAY 
 
MERRY and PIPPIN stand waist-deep in the water. 
 
   MERRY 
 He doesn’t look too happy, does he? 
 
   PIPPIN 
 Not too happy at all, Merry. 
 
ANGLE ON: SARUMAN and WORMTONGUE look hopelessly down from their 
prison. 
 
ANGLE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN watching them near the outer wall. 
 
   MERRY 
 Still, I suppose the view would be 
 quite nice from up there. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
212. 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
   PIPPIN 
 Oh, yes, it’s a quality establishment. 
 I hear the staff are very good. 
 
MERRY holds his hand out from his head, measuring his height 
against PIPPIN’S. PIPPIN catches this out of the corner of his 
eye. MERRY pretends to be playing with his hair. 
 
   PIPPIN 
 What are you doing? 
 
   MERRY 
 Nothing. The world’s back to normal, 
 that’s all. 
 
   PIPPIN 
 No, it isn’t. I’m starving. 
 
MERRY picks up a floating basket and tosses out its contents. 
 
   MERRY  
 Good luck trying to find something 
 decent to eat around here. Probably 
 dead rats and moldy bread. 
 
PIPPIN picks up a floating apple. He looks to the sky for a 
moment trying to figure out where it came from. Suddenly, he  
sees another....and another... 
 
MERRY sees what is happening. They follow the trail of apples 
until they find a turkey...and then a basket of apples...and 
then... 
 
JACKPOT! The HOBBITS look with rapt anticipation at the food 
storehouse in the WALL OF ISENGARD. 
 
   MERRY (CONT’D) 
 Saruman’s storeroom! 
 
CLOSE ON: TWO BARRELS LABELED FROM THE SOUTHFARTHING OF THE 
SHIRE! 
 
ANGLE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN look with reverent awe on the  
barrels. 
 
   PIPPIN 
 I don’t believe it.  
      (CONTINUED) 
213. 
 
CONTINUED: (2) 
 
   MERRY 
 It can’t be. 
 
ANGLE ON: They crack open the top of one of the barrels. 
 
   MERRY (CONT’D) 
 It is! 
 
   PIPPIN 
 Longbottom Leaf. 
 
MERRY takes a huge sniff of it. 
 
   MERRY 
  (with pleasure) 
 The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing. 
 
   PIPPIN 
 It’s perfect. One barrel each.  
 
PIPPIN suddenly stops. 
 
   PIPPIN (CONT’D) 
 Wait. Do you think we should share it  
 with Treebeard? 
 
   MERRY 
 Share it? 
  (shaking his head) 
 No. No. Dead plant and all that. Don’t  
 think he’d understand. 
 
He leans into PIPPIN. 
 
   MERRY (CONT’D) 
  (quietly) 
 Could be a distant relative. 
 
PIPPIN smiles. 
 
   PIPPIN 
 I get it. Don’t be hasty. 
 
MERRY whips out his pipe. 
 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
214.

   MERRY 
 Exactly. 
  (deeply) 
 Bah-hrum. 
 
MERRY and PIPPIN laugh. 
 
ANGLE ON: TREEBEARD passes close to the storeroom. He hears the 
laughing and looks in on them. 
 
     CUT TO: 
 
EXT. OSGILIATH - DAY 
 
FARAMIR leads FRODO, SAM, and GOLLUM through the turmoil to a 
water logged tunnel. 
 
   FARAMIR 
 This is the old sewer. Runs right 
 under the river through to the edge 
 of the city. You’ll find cover in  
 the woods there. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM look at him gratefully. 
 
   SAM 
 Captain Faramir...you have shown your 
 quality, sir.  
 
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR stands back, surprised at SAM’S words. 
 
   SAM (CONT’D) 
 The very highest. 
 
   FARAMIR 
 The Shire must really be a great realm,  
 Master Gamgee, where gardeners are held  
 in high honor. 
 
ANGLE ON: SAM looks away, embarrassed. FARAMIR smiles. 
 
   FARAMIR (CONT’D) 
 What road will you take once you reach  
 the woods? 
 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
215. 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
   FRODO 
 Gollum says there’s a path near Minas  
 Morgul that climbs up into the  
 mountains. 
 
FARAMIR looks surprised. GOLLUM tries to slink away. 
 
   FARAMIR 
 Cirith Ungol? 
 
FARAMIR snatches GOLLUM up by the neck and holds him against the 
wall. 
 
   FARAMIR (CONT’D) 
 Is that its name? 
 
   GOLLUM 
 No. No! 
 
FARAMIR tightens his grip. 
 
   GOLLUM (CONT’D) 
 Yes. 
 
FARAMIR turns to FRODO desperately. 
 
   FARAMIR 
 Frodo, they say a dark terror dwells 
 in the passes above Minas Morgul. You  
 cannot go that way. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO, rapt with indecision. 
 
   GOLLUM 
 It is the only way. Master says we 
 must go to Mordor, so we must try. 
 
FARAMIR looks to FRODO, seemingly desperate to talk him out of 
it. FRODO looks resolute again. 
 
   FRODO 
 I must. 
 
FARAMIR throws GOLLUM down. He stands before FRODO and SAM. 
 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
216.

   FARAMIR 
 Go, Frodo. Go with the goodwill of 
 all Men. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO looks at FARAMIR, touched by his sincerity. 
 
   FRODO 
 Thank you. 
 
FRODO starts off into the sewer...SAM follows. 
 
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM starts to slink to the sewer...FARAMIR grabs 
him up by the neck again, pinning him against the wall. 
 
CLOSE ON: FARAMIR looks at GOLLUM intently. 
 
   FARAMIR 
 May death find you quickly if you  
 bring them to harm. 
 
GOLLUM doesn’t respond. FARAMIR throws him into the tunnel. 
GOLLUM slinks away, with a final, scathing glance to FARAMIR. 
 
INT. OSGILIATH SEWER TUNNEL - DAY 
 
FRODO and SAM walk easily through the tunnel. GOLLUM limps 
behind them. 
 
   FRODO 
 Come on, keep up. 
 
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM slumps to the ground, in pain. SAM stops. 
 
   SAM 
 Mr. Frodo didn’t mean for them Rangers  
 to hurt you. You know that, don’t you? 
 He was trying to save you, see? 
 
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM looks up to SAM in wonder. 
 
   GOLLUM 
 Save me? 
 
   SAM 
 So there’s no hard feelings. Forgive  
 and forget.

217.

   GOLLUM 
  (shaking his head) 
 No, no, no hard feelings. 
  (coughing) 
 Gollum, Gollum. Yes, master. 
 
SAM steps back for GOLLUM to pass. 
 
WIDE ON: GOLLUM crawls into the culvert, following FRODO. SAM 
stands back and waits for him to wriggle his way in. 
 
   GOLLUM (CONT’D) 
 Nice Hobbits. 
 
   SAM 
 Very decent of you. Very decent, 
 indeed, Gollum.

GANDALF, ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, GIMLI, THÉODEN, and ÉOMER ride to the 
top of the rise in front of HELM’S DEEP, looking off into the 
distance. 
 
   GANDALF 
 Sauron’s wrath will be terrible, 
 his retribution swift.  
 
WIDE ON: In the far distance, the skies over MORDOR crackle and 
the darkness spreads. 
 
ANGLES ON: The others look to GANDALF as he speaks. 
 
   GANDALF (CONT’D) 
 The battle for Helm’s Deep is over. The 
 battle for Middle-earth is about to 
 begin. All our hopes now lie with two 
 little Hobbits...  
 
EXT. ITHILIEN - DAY 
 
GOLLUM leads FRODO and SAM through the woods.

218. 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
   GANDALF (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
 ...somewhere in the wilderness.  
 
   SAM 
 I wonder if we’ll ever be put into 
 songs or tales.  
 
   FRODO 
 What?  
 
   SAM 
 I wonder if people will ever say, 
 “Let’s hear about Frodo and the Ring.” 
 And they’ll say “Yes, that’s one of my 
 favorite stories. Frodo was really 
 courageous, wasn’t he, dad.” “Yes, my 
 boy, the most famousest of Hobbits. And 
 that’s saying a lot.”  
 
FRODO laughs and turns to SAM. 
 
   FRODO 
 Well, you’ve left out one of the chief 
 characters: “Samwise the Brave.” I 
 want to hear more about Sam.  
 
FRODO turns to SAM. SAM smiles sheepishly. FRODO’S smile fades. 
He stops and turns to SAM, seriously. 
 
   FRODO 
 Frodo wouldn’t have got far without 
 Sam.  
 
   SAM 
 Now Mr. Frodo, you shouldn’t make fun.  
 I was being serious. 
 
   FRODO 
  (smiling)  
 So was I.  
 
FRODO walks onward.

in the distance.  
 
   FRODO 
 Sméagol!  
 
   SAM 
 We’re not gonna wait for you. Come 
 on!  
 
PAN TO: GOLLUM crawls over a short hill, struggling. 
 
   SMÉAGOL 
 Master. Master looks after us. Master 
 wouldn’t hurt us.  
 
   GOLLUM 
 Master broke his promise.  
 
   SMÉAGOL 
 Don’t ask Sméagol. Poor, poor Sméagol.  
 
   GOLLUM 
 Master betrayed us. Wicked. Tricksy. 
 False. We ought to wring his filthy 
 little neck. Kill him! Kill him! Kill 
  them both. And then we take the precious 
 and we be the master! 
 
SMÉAGOL runs and hides behind a tree. 
 
   SMÉAGOL 
 But the fat Hobbit, he knows. Eyes 
 always watching. 
 
GOLLUM peeks out from behind the other side of the tree. 
 
   GOLLUM 
 Then we stabs them out. Put out his 
 eyeses and make him crawl.

SMÉAGOL nods eagerly. 
 
   SMÉAGOL 
 Yes! Yes! Yes!  
 
   GOLLUM 
 Kill them both.  
 
   SMÉAGOL 
 Yes! No! No!  
 
He backs away from the tree. 
 
   SMÉAGOL 
 It’s too risky. It’s too risky.  
 
ANGLE ON: The HOBBITS come over the rise behind GOLLUM. 
 
   SAM 
 Where is he? Where’s he gone? Hey, 
 Gollum! Where are you?  
 
   FRODO 
 Sméagol? 
 
   GOLLUM 
  (thoughtfully)  
 We could let her do it.  
 
   SMÉAGOL 
 Yes. She could do it.  
 
   GOLLUM 
 Yes, precious, she could. And then 
 we takes it once they’re dead.  
 
   SMÉAGOL 
 Once they’re dead. 
 
   GOLLUM 
 Shh. 
 
With a smile, GOLLUM leaps out of hiding.

Great Rings.  
 
IMAGE: THREE RINGS, each set with a single GEM, are received by 
the HIGH ELVES - GALADRIEL, GIL-GALAD and CIRDAN. 
 
  GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
Three were given to the Elves: 
immortal, wisest ... fairest of all 
beings.

  GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
Seven to the Dwarf Lords: great miners 
and craftsmen of the mountain halls.

if holding-close a precious secret. 
 
  GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
And Nine ... nine rings were gifted  
to the race of Men, who above all else  
desire power.

TEASING SHOTS: SAURON forging the ONE RING in the CHAMBERS of 
SAMMATH NAUR.

In the land of Mordor, in the fires of 
Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged 
in secret a Master Ring to control all 
others.

       FADE TO BLACK. 
 
  GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
But there were some ... who resisted.  
 
FADE UP: ISILDUR, son of the KING OF GONDOR, leads an ARMY  
ACROSS the PLAINS OF DAGORLAD... 
 
  GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
A last alliance of Men and Elves 
marched against the armies of Mordor. 
On the slopes of Mount Doom, they 
fought for the freedom of Middle-Earth.

Victory was near!  
 
IMAGES: THE HUGE, DARK FIGURE OF SAURON, bearing the ONE RING 
on his finger, looms over the field of battle...

But the power of the Ring could not be 
undone.

It was in this moment ... when all hope 
had faded, that Isildur, son of the 
king, took up his father's sword. 
 
ISILDUR snatches up the BROKEN BLADE OF NARSIL ... The BLADE  
severs SAURON’S FINGERS ... AND THE ONE RING FLIES from his  
body. 
 
    GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
Sauron, the enemy of the Free Peoples 
of Middle-Earth, was defeated.  
 
SAURON’S ARMOUR clatters to the ground, his body GONE ... 
VAPROIZED!  
 
CLOSE ON: ISILDUR picks up the SEVERED FINGER and removes the  
ONE RING ... transfixed!

The Ring passed to Isildur ... who had 
this one chance to destroy evil 
forever.

through DARKENING WOODS ... the ONE RING glinting on a CHAIN 
around his neck.

But the hearts of Men are easily 
corrupted. And the Ring of Power has 
a will of its own.  
 
SUDDENLY! ARROWS FLY! They are ambushed by ORCS ... ISIDULR  
is THROWN from his HORSE! 
 
ISILDUR stumbles to his feet and in a PANIC, puts on the the 
RING and DISAPPEARS! 
 
INVISIBLE ISILDUR flees from the BATTLE and jumps into  
the RIVER ANDUIN. 
 
ISILDUR MATERIALIZES UNDER WATER ... as the RING slips slowly 
from his finger. He grasps for it, desperately. 
 
ORCS on the RIVERBANK spot him in the WATER. They fire a  
BARRAGE OF ARROWS into him. 
 
ISILDUR JERKS. Ripples of light play across ISILDUR’S PALE FACE

And some things that should not 
have been forgotten ... were lost. 
 
       FADE TO BLACK 
 
  GALADRIEL (V.O.) 
Thus a Third Age of Middle-Earth 
began. History became legend ... 
legend became myth.  
 
FADE UP: The waters of the ANDUIN RIVER lie dark and  
undisturbed.

And for two and a half thousand years, 
the Ring passed out of all knowledge.

  It came to me. My own. My love... 
   (ecstatic whisper) 
  My preciousness.

The Ring gave to Gollum unnatural long 
life. For five hundred years it 
poisoned his mind. And in the gloom of 
Gollum's cave...

STILL ... the unsettled quiet before the storm...

  Darkness crept back into the forests  
of the world. Rumor grew of a Shadow in 
the East ... whispers of a nameless 
fear. And the Ring of Power perceived 
... its time had now come. It abandoned 
Gollum.

FLOOR of a MOUNTAIN TUNNEL...

A YOUNGISH LOOKING BILBO BAGGINS peers down at what lies in

A Hobbit ... Bilbo Baggins of the 
Shire.

  the Big Folk. Middle-earth being, after  
  all, full of strange creatures beyond

A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins,

     GANDALF 
What, everything? Far too eager and 
curious for a Hobbit. Most unnatural... 
Well, what can I tell you? Life in the 
wide world goes on much as it has this 
past age. Full of its own comings and 
goings, scarcely even aware of the 
existence of Hobbits... 
 
CLOSE ON: GANDALF as he surveys the peaceful scene before him.

anything unexpected.

joke.

front door set into a grassy hillside. There is a sign on the 
gate which reads: “NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT ON PARTY BUSINESS.”  
 
GANDALF strides up the garden path of BAG END. He raises his 
staff and raps on the front door ... a voice calls out:

  No thank you! We don't want any more  
  visitors, well-wishers, or distant  
  relations. 
 
     GANDALF 
  And what about very old friends? 
 
Suddenly the door opens and BILBO BAGGINS stands before him. He 
is a HOBBIT OF INDETERMINATE AGE, with a mischeivous TWINKLE in 
his eye. Wearing a dashing brocade waist coat, he look every 
inch the eccentric gentleman.

  I was expecting you last week. Not that 
  it matters, you come and go as you  
  please, always have done, always will.

BILBO jumps, a half eaten pork pie in his hand, as GANDALF 
mysteriously appears behind him. 
 
     GANDALF 
  Just tea, thank you. 
 
     BILBO 
  Oh ... right. You don’t mind if...? 
 
     GANDALF 
  No, not at all. Go ahead. 
 
A SUDDEN LOUD KNOCK ON THE FRONT DOOR. 
  
     LOBELIA (O.S.) 
  Bilbo Baggins, you open this door... 
 
     BILBO 
I'm not home. 
 
BILBO tiptoes to the window and peeps out. 
 
     BILBO 
   (whispers) 
  It’s the Sackville-Bagginses! 
 
     LOBELIA (O.S.) 
  I know you’re in there! 
 
     BILBO 
   (whispers) 
  They’re after the house. They’ve 
   never forgiven me for living this 
   long! 
 
GANDALF watches, amused, as BILBO tries to hide.

   BILBO 
I’ve got to get away from these 
confounded relatives, hanging on the 
bell all day, never giving me a moment's 
peace. I want to see mountains again ... 
mountains, Gandalf ... and then find 
somewhere quiet where I can finish my 
book ... oh, Tea! 
 
     GANDALF 
  So, you mean to go through with your 
   plan, then? 
 
     BILBO 
  Yes, yes ... it’s all in hand. All the 
   arrangements are made. 
 
     GANDALF 
  Frodo suspects something. 
 
     BILBO 
‘Course he does, he's a Baggins ... not 
some blockheaded Bracegirdle from 
Hardbottle! 
 
     GANDALF 
  You will tell him, won't you? 
 
     BILBO 
  Yes, yes. 
 
     GANDALF 
  He’s very fond of you. 
 
     BILBO 
I know. He’d probably come with me if I 
asked him. I think, in his heart, 
Frodo’s still in love with the Shire, 
the woods and the fields ... little 
rivers.  
 
BILBO stands gazing out of the kitchen window. 
 
   BILBO (CONT’D) 
I am old, Gandalf...  
 
BILBO looks at GANDALF sadly...

   BILBO (CONT’D) 
I know I don’t look it, but I’m 
beginning to feel it in my heart.  
 
CLOSE ON: BILBO’S fingers close around his waistcoat pocket ... 
gripping a small, unseen object. 
 
   BILBO (CONT’D) 
I feel thin ... sort of stretched, like 
butter scraped over too much bread. I 
need a holiday ... a very long holiday 
and I don’t expect I shall return ... 
in fact, I mean not to.

INT. BAG END - EVENING 
 
GANDALF and BILBO are sitting on the BAG END porch. BELOW THEM, 
final preparations are being made on the PARTY field. BILBO 
strikes a match and lights his pipe. 
 
     BILBO 
  Old Toby. The finest weed in the 
   Southfarthing! 
 
BILBO blows a perfect smoke ring and watches it rise into the 
air. A tiny sailing ship with masts and sails glides through the 
CENTER of BILBO’S smoke ring. 
 
     BILBO (CONT’D) 
  Ohhhh. 
   (smiles) 
  Gandalf, my old friend ... this will 
   be a night to remember.

EXT. PARTY FIELD, HOBBITON - NIGHT 
 
BOOM! A FIREWORK explodes into the night sky high above HOBBITON 
... in the shape of a great green tree with unfolding branches. 
 
TILT DOWN: with glowing flowers as they rain down from the 
branches ... evaporating just above the upturned faces of the 
delighted party-goers.  
 
      (CONTINUED) 
21. 
 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
144 HOBBITS, feasting and drinking CARTS of beer and wine are 
scattered about, and the tables are piled high with steaming 
scones and savories. 
 
GANDALF hurries about, lighting fireworks with a blue spark that 
dances magically from his staff ... BILBO is greeting visitors.  
 
     BILBO 
  Hello, hello, Fatty Bolger, lovely 
  to see you! Welcome, welcome! 
 
FRODO and SAM sit at a table drinking ale ... FRODO notices 
SAM’S eyes keep flicking to another pretty HOBBIT, ROSIE COTTON, 
sitting some distance away. 
 
     FRODO 
  Go on, Sam, ask Rosie for a dance. 
 
     SAM 
   (horrified) 
  I think I'll just have myself another  
  ale. 
 
     FRODO 
  Oh, no you don't. Go on. 
 
SAM goes to drain his glass ... suddenly it is snatched out of 
his hands as FRODO thrusts him into the middle of a passing 
throng of dancers. 
 
ANGLE ON: SAM’S HORRIFIED FACE as he is SWEPT away. FRODO laughs 
and finishes SAM’S beer. 
 
ANGLE ON: GANDALF as he sets alight a particularly spectacular 
firework that draws gasps of admiration from the party guests. 
 
CLOSE ON: BILBO is relating stories of his adventure to a group 
of YOUNG HOBBIT CHILDREN. 
 
     BILBO 
   (melodramatic) 
So there I was ... at the mercy of three 
monstrous trolls ... Have you ever heard 
of a Troll? Do you know what a Troll is? 
Great big nasty twenty foot high smelly 
things ... and they’re arguing ... 
arguing about how they were going to 
cook us!  
 
    (CONTINUED) 
22. 
 
 
CONTINUED: (2) 
 
ANGLE ON: A LITTLE HOBBIT GIRL’S upturned face ... her eyes 
growing larger and larger. 
 
   BILBO (CONT’D) 
Whether it be turned on a spit or minced 
in a pie or whether they were going to 
sit on us one by one and squash us into 
jelly! They spent so long arguing the 
whither-to’s and why-for’s that the 
sun’s first light cracked over the top 
of the trees ... and turned them all to 
stone! 
 
STUNNED GASPS from his young AUDIENCE greet his astonishing 
feat! 
 
CLOSE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN, two mischeivous YOUNG HOBBITS in 
their late teens. PIPPIN scrambles onto the back of GANDALF’S 
wagon, snatching up a small firework. 
 
     MERRY 
  No, no ... the big one ... the big one! 
 
PIPPIN grabs a huge rocket. MERRY smiles. The pair runs off with 
it. 
 
ANGLE ON: BILBO continues to greet his guests. He shakes hands 
with a woman who is tailed by an overwhelming crowd of CHILDREN. 
 
     BILBO 
  Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you!  
  Welcome, welcome. Are all these  
  children yours? 
 
MRS. BRACEGIRDLE laughs with tired eyes and nods. 
 
     BILBO 
  Good gracious, you have been  
  productive. 
 
MRS. BRACEGIRDLE laughs and nods.  
 
SUDDENLY! Bilbo’s ears are assailed by a familiar strident 
VOICE. 
 
     LOBELIA (O.S.) 
  Bilbo? 
 
BILBO quickly runs to FRODO. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
23.

     BILBO 
   (panicked) 
  Sackville-Bagginses! Quickly! Hide! 
 
BILBO and FRODO quickly hide behind the wall of a tent.  
 
ANGLE ON: OTHO AND LOBELIA SACKVILLE-BAGGINS ... an older, 
grumpy-looking pair with sharp eyes ... emerge and look about 
the party like vultures searching for prey.  
 
ANGLE ON: BILBO breathes a huge sigh of relief. 
 
      BILBO 
  Thank you, my boy. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO chuckles.  
 
 BILBO 
 (suddenly serious) 
 You're a good lad, Frodo. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO stares at his UNCLE, perturbed by the change of 
tone. 
 
 BILBO (CONT’D) 
I'm very selfish, you know. Yes, I am 
... very selfish. I don't know why I 
took you in after your mother and 
father died, but it wasn't out of 
charity. I think ... it was because, of 
all my numerous relations ... you were 
the one Baggins that showed real 
spirit.  
 
 FRODO 
  Bilbo, have you been at the Gaffer's  
  home brew? 
 
 BILBO 
No. Well, yes. But that's not the 
point. The point is, Frodo ... you'll 
be all right. 
 
BILBO lifts his mug and takes a drink ... probably of the 
Gaffer’s home brew. 
 
CLOSE ON: FIREWORK FUSE crackles with flame! 
 
      (CONTINUED)

ANGLE ON: MERRY is holding out the big rocket ... he looks aghst 
at the fizzing fuse that PIPPIN has just lit. 
 
     MERRY (CONT’D) 
   (worried whisper) 
  You're supposed to stick it in the  
  ground! 
 
     PIPPIN 
  It is in the ground. 
 
MERRY fearfully tosses the ROCKET to PIPPIN! the fuse sizzles 
angrily. 
 
     MERRY 
  Outside! 
 
     PIPPIN 
  This was your idea. 
 
PIPPIN attempts to throw the fizzing rocket back to MERRY.  
 
WHOOSH! The two HOBBITS are suddenly blown off their feet in a 
shower of sparks as the rocket blasts off with frightening 
power. 
 
ANGLE ON: The ROCKET ZOOMS over the party ... it suddenly bursts 
apart, forming the shape of a great red golden DRAGON! Fire fire 
gushes from its nostrils as it turns back and FLIES towards the 
startled crowd. 
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO watches the FIREWORKS DRAGON with alarm ... but 
BILBO is oblivious to the PANICKING CROWD and impending danger! 
 
     FRODO 
  Bilbo! Watch out for the dragon!! 
 
     BILBO 
  Dragon? Nonsense ... hasn't been a  
  dragon in these parts for a thousand  
  years! 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO as he hurriedly pulls BILBO to the ground, just 
as the dragon roars a few feet above their heads like a flaming 
express train!  
 
HOBBITS dive to the ground, tables overturn, tents collapse, 
food flies everywhere.

The FIREWORKS DRAGON turns a somersault and explodes over the 
hills with a deafening BANG! This gets the biggest cheer of the 
night. 
 
ANGLE ON: MERRY AND PIPPIN, clothes and hair smoking. 
 
     MERRY 
  That was good! 
 
     PIPPIN 
  Let's get another one! 
 
LARGE HANDS suddenly clamp down on MERRY and PIPPIN’S ears. 
 
LOW ANGLE: GANDALF looking DOWN STERNLY! 
 
     GANDALF 
  Meriadoc Brandybuck, and Peregrin Took  
  ... I might have known! 
 
      CUT TO: 
 
MERRY and PIPPIN are leaning over a barrel, washing dishes in 
soapy water ... with GANDALF sitting nearby, smoking his pipe 
and sipping an ale.  
 
Cries of “SPEECH! SPEECH!” erupt from the party. 
 
ANGLE ON: BILBO stepping on a stool ... he bows in gratitude at 
the applause. 
 
     FRODO 
  Speech! 
 
     BILBO 
   (clearing his throat) 
My dear Bagginses and Boffins, Tooks 
and Brandybucks ... Grubbs, Chubbs, 
Burrowses, Hornblowers, Bolgers, 
Bracegirdles, Goodbodies, Brockhouses 
and Proudfoots...

   PROUDFOOT 
  Proudfeet!

     BILBO 
Proudfoots. Also my good 
Sackville-Bagginses that I welcome 
back at last to Bag End.  
 
ANGLE ON: OTHO and LOBELIA scowl at BILBO. He doesn’t care. 
 
   BILBO (CONT’D) 
Today is my one hundred and eleventh 
birthday. I am eleventy-one today! Yes, 
and alas ... Eleventy-one years is far 
too short a time to live among such 
excellent and admirable Hobbits!  
 
Tremendous outburst of approval! 
 
   BILBO (CONT’D) 
I don't know half of you half as well 
as I should like, and I like less than 
half of you half as well as you 
deserve!  
 
SCATTERED CLAPPING as the guests try to work out if that was a 
compliment or not. 
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO AND GANDALF smiling to themselves. 
 
CLOSE ON: BILBO ... a strange HUM seems to fill his head. A bead 
of sweat rolls down his brow. 
 
BILBO’S hand pulls something out of his waistcoat pocket and 
holds it behind his back. 
 
   BILBO (CONT’D) 
I have ... things to do and I have put 
this off for far too long.  
 
CLOSE ON: BILBO’S knuckles turn white as he tightens his grip on 
the small object behind his back. 
 
   BILBO (CONT’D) 
I regret to announce this is the end. I 
am going now. I bid you all a very fond 
farewell!! 
 
BILBO looks across at FRODO, hesitates... then...

EXT. BAG END - NIGHT 
 
The party is still in an excited uproar ... some 50 yards away 
as we PAN across a moonlit lane to the front door of BAG END. 
Door opens, pulled by an invisible hand. 
 
INT. BAG END - NIGHT 
 
The door quietly closes ... BILBO materializes as he pulls a 
plain gold ring off his finger. BILBO laughs as he tosses the 
ring in the air, then places it in his pocket. 
 
ANGLE ON: BILBO emerges from the passage, carrying a walking 
stick. He finds GANDALF looming over him. 
 
 
     GANDALF 
I suppose you think that was terribly 
clever? 
 
     BILBO 
  Come on, Gandalf. Did you see their  
  faces? 
 
     GANDALF 
There are many magic rings in this 
world, Bilbo Baggins, and none of them 
should be used lightly. 
 
     BILBO 
  It was just a bit of fun. Oh, you’re  
  probably right, as usual.    
 
     BILBO 
  You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't  
  you? 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
28. 
 
 
CONTINUED:  
 
     GANDALF 
  Two eyes. As often as I can spare them. 
 
     BILBO 
  I'm leaving everything to him. 
 
     GANDALF 
  What about this ring of yours? Is that  
  staying too? 
 
CLOSE ON: BILBO ... he gives GANDALF a look and nods towards the 
mantelpiece. 
 
     BILBO 
  Yes, yes, it's in an envelope ... over 
  there on the mantelpiece. 
 
GANDALF frowns at the empty mantelpiece ... BILBO suddenly feels 
his waistcoat with a look of guilty surprise. 
 
     BILBO (CONT’D) 
No, wait. It’s here in my pocket. Isn't 
that ... isn’t that odd, now? Yet, 
after all, why not? Why shouldn't I 
keep it? 
 
     GANDALF 
  I think you should leave the Ring  
  behind, Bilbo. Is that so hard? 
 
     BILBO 
Well, no ... and yes. Now it comes to 
it, I don't feel like parting with it. 
It’s mine. I found it. It came to me! 
 
ANGLE ON: GANDALF LOOKS DOWN AT BILBO WITH RISING CONCERN. 
 
     GANDALF 
  There's no need to get angry. 
 
     BILBO 
Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!  
It's mine. My own, my precious. 
 
     GANDALF 
  Precious? It's been called that before,  
  but not by you.

     BILBO 
  What business is it of yours what I do  
  with my own things? 
 
BILBO’S voice, shape and manner have suddenly changed. 
 
     GANDALF 
  I think you've had that ring quite  
  long enough. 
 
     BILBO 
  You want it for yourself! 
 
GANDALF rises to his full height, his eyes flash, his shadow 
suddenly seems to fill the room. 
 
     GANDALF 
  Bilbo Baggins, do not take me for some  
  conjurer of cheap tricks!  
 
BILBO cowers from GANDALF, disarmed by his power ... a 
frightened HOBBIT. GANDALF’S expression softens. 
 
     GANDALF (CONT’D) 
  I am not trying to rob you. I am trying  
  to help you.  
 
Sobbing, BILBO runs to GANDALF and hugs him. 
 
     GANDALF (CONT’D) 
All your long years we’ve been friends 
... trust me as you once did. Let it 
go! 
 
     BILBO 
You're right, Gandalf. The Ring must go 
to Frodo.  
 
BILBO lifts his knapsack and heads for the front door. 
 
   BILBO (CONT’D) 
It's late, the road is long ... yes, it 
is time. 
 
     GANDALF 
  Bilbo? 
 
     BILBO 
  Hmmm?

     GANDALF 
  The Ring is still in your pocket. 
 
BILBO hesitates ... reaches into his pocket. 
 
     BILBO 
  Oh, yes. 
 
CLOSE ON: BILBO pulls out the ring ... he stares at it in his 
palm. With all his will power, BILBO allows the ring to slowly 
slide off his palm and drop to the floor. 
 
CLOSE ON: The tiny ring lands with a heavy thud on the wooden 
floor. 
 
EXT. BAG END - NIGHT 
 
ANGLE ON: BILBO staggering out of BAG END ... he braces himself 
in the night air, PALE and TREMBLING, as if his loss of the ring 
has weakened him. GANDALF steps up behind. 
 
     BILBO 
I've thought up an ending for my 
book... “And he lived happily ever 
after to the end of his days.” 
 
     GANDALF 
  I'm sure you will, my dear friend. 
 
     BILBO 
  Goodbye, Gandalf. 
 
     GANDALF 
  Goodbye, Bilbo. 
 
BILBO walks away from BAG END, disappearing into the night, 
softly singing: “The Road goes on and on.”

for the RING. His fingers barely touch the RING ... the creepy 
HUM rises on the SOUNDTRACK. 
 
ANGLE ON: GANDALF is sitting in front of the fire, with his pipe 
... staring into the flickering flames.

  Riddles in the dark. 
 
     FRODO (O.S.) 
  Bilbo! Bilbo! 
 
FRODO rushes into BAG END ... he stops and picks up the RING at 
his feet. GANDALF continues staring into the fire, as if locked 
in thought. 
 
     GANDALF 
   (to himself) 
  My precious ... precious... 
 
     FRODO 
 (quietly) 
He's gone, hasn't he?  
 
FRODO steps into the living room. 
 
   FRODO (CONT’D) 
He talked for so long about leaving ... 
I didn’t think he’d really do it.  
 
   GANDALF

He's left you Bag End... 
 
GANDALF holds out the envelope ... FRODO drops the RING into it. 
 
   GANDALF (CONT’D) 
...along with all his possessions.  
 
GANDALF seals the envelope with wax. He hands it to FRODO. 
 
 GANDALF (CONT’D) 
  The ring is yours now. Put it somewhere  
  out of sight. 
 
GANDALF rises hurriedly and starts to gather his things. 
 
     FRODO 
  Where are you going? 
 
     GANDALF 
  There are things I must to see to. 
 
     FRODO 
  What things? 
 
     GANDALF 
  Questions. Questions that need  
  answering. 
 
     FRODO 
  But you've only just arrived! I don't  
  understand... 
 
GANDALF is already at the door, he turns to FRODO. 
 
     GANDALF 
  Neither do I. Keep it secret, Keep

          Rain may fall and wind may blow.  
          But there still be –  
          many miles to go!  
 
          Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain,  
          and the stream that falls from hill to plain.  
          Better than rain or rippling brook –  
 
 PIPPIN

Huge laughter and clinking of mugs.

  There's been some strange folk crossing

 TED SANDYMAN 
  War is brewing. The mountains are fair  
  teeming with goblins. 
 
ANGLE ON: SAM, smokes his pipe and looks at ROSIE behind the 
bar. She gives him a huge smile. 
 
 GAFFER 
  Far-off tales and children's stories,  
  that's all that is. You're beginning to  
  sound like that old Bilbo Baggins.  
  Cracked, he was. 
 
 TED SANDYMAN 
  Young Mr. Frodo here, he's cracking! 
 
He laughs as FRODO arrives with drinks. 
 
 FRODO 
  And proud of it. Cheers, Gaffer. 
 
 GAFFER 
  Well, it's none of our concern what   
  goes on beyond our borders. Keep your  
  nose out of trouble, and no trouble'll  
  come to you. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO smiles and raises his tankard. 
 
LATER...

 ROSIE 
  Goodnight, lads.

  Goodnight.

FRODO and SAM continue on their way. Behind them, an intoxicated 
HOBBIT kneels before ROSIE and raises his arms as if worshipping 
a goddess. 
 
 INTOXICATED HOBBIT 
  Goodnight, sweet maiden of the  
  golden ale! 
 
 SAM 
 (muttering) 
  Mind who you're sweet-talking.

  Don't worry, Sam. Rosie knows an

sensing that something is amiss. All is quiet ... FRODO peers 
uneasily into the darkened living room. 
 
SUDDENLY! A large figure looms out of the shadows, reaching for 
FRODO. FRODO lets out a startled cry, pulls himself free and 
spins around to face his ASSAILANT. 
 
GANDALF steps into a shaft of moonlight. Paranoia blazes in his 
eyes. His clothes are dirty and ragged from much traveling. Hair

Without a word, GANDALF takes the envelope and tosses it into 
the fireplace! 
 
     FRODO 
   (bewildered) 
  What are you doing? 
 
Flames instantly consume the envelope ... revealing the RING, as 
it sinks into the red hot embers. GANDALF reaches into the fire 
with a pair of tongs ... he lifts the RING out. 
 
     GANDALF 
Hold out your hand, Frodo ... it is 
quite cool.  
 
GANDALF drops the RING into FRODO’S hand ... he reacts to its 
weight.

What can you see? Can you see anything?

Nothing ... there's nothing. Wait...

  Mordor? 
 
     GANDALF 
In the common tongue, it says:

     GANDALF 
This is the One Ring, forged by the 
Dark Lord Sauron, in the fires of Mount 
Doom ... taken by Isildur from the hand 
of Sauron himself. 
 
     FRODO 
   (quiet realization) 
  Bilbo found it ... in Gollum's cave. 
 
     GANDALF 
Yes. For sixty years, the Ring lay quiet 
in Bilbo’s keeping, prolonging his life, 
delaying old age ... but no longer, 
Frodo. Evil is stirring in Mordor. The 
Ring has awoken. It's heard its master's 
call. 
 
AT THAT MOMENT: A FLEETING, LOW WHISPER OF BLACK SPEECH emanates 
from the RING. FRODO looks at GANDALF, each knowing the other 
has heard it. 
 
     FRODO 
  But he was destroyed ... Sauron was  
  destroyed. 
 
ANGLE ON: THE RING lies between them on the table.

     GANDALF 
No, Frodo. The spirit of Sauron endured. 
His life force is bound to the Ring and 
the Ring survived. Sauron has returned. 
His Orcs have multiplied ... his 
fortress of Barad-dûr is rebuilt in the 
land of Mordor. Sauron needs only this 
Ring to cover all the lands in the 
second darkness. He is seeking it, 
seeking it, all his thought is bent on 
it. For the Ring yearns, above all else, 
to return to the hand of its master: 
They are one, the Ring and the Dark 
Lord. Frodo, he must never find it.

GANDALF shifts uncomfortably. 
 
     FRODO (CONT’D) 
  Do they, Gandalf? 
 
GANDALF looks at FRODO sadly... 
 
     GANDALF 
There is one other who knew that Bilbo

Understand, Frodo ... I would use this 
Ring from a desire to do good ... but

Travel only by day. And stay off the

I can cut across country easily enough. 
 
GANDALF looks at the young HOBBIT, moved by his courage. 
 
     GANDALF 
My dear Frodo. Hobbits really are 
amazing creatures. You can learn all 
there is to know about their ways in a

  Confound it all! Samwise Gamgee, have you

I ain’t been dropping no eaves, sir! 
Honest. I was just cutting the grass 
under the window there, if you follow 
me...

It’s a little bit late for trimming the 
hedges, don’t you think? 
 
   SAM 
I heard raised voices... 
 
   GANDALF 
What did you hear? Speak! 
 
   SAM 
Nothing important ... that is, I heard 
a good deal about a ring ... and a Dark 
Lord.  And something about the end of 
the world, but... Please, Mr. Gandalf, 
sir, don't hurt me! Don't turn me into 
anything unnatural!

  All these long years, it was in the

GANDALF and SARUMAN are seated in a small, cluttered room to the

     SARUMAN 
  Sauron has regained much of his former  
  strength. He cannot yet take physical  
  form ... but his spirit has lost none of  
  its potency. Concealed within his  
  fortress, the Lord of Mordor sees all.  
  His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth  
  and flesh. You know of what I speak,  
  Gandalf ... a Great Eye, lidless,   
  wreathed in flame. 
 
     GANDALF 
   (softly) 
  The Eye of Sauron. 
 
     SARUMAN 
  He is gathering all evil to him. Very  
  soon, he will have summoned an army  
  great enough to launch an assault on  
  Middle earth. 
 
     GANDALF 
  You know this? How? 
 
     SARUMAN 
  I have seen it. 
 
GANDALF and SARUMAN stride through ORTHANC toward a stone plinth 
on which a sphere like shape is draped with a cloth...

  They crossed the River Isen on  
  Midsummer's Eve, disguised as riders in  
  black.

   (alarmed) 
  They have reached the Shire? 
 
SARUMAN shrugs... 
 
     SARUMAN 
  They will find the Ring ... and kill 
  the one who carries it. 
 
GANDALF backs away and turns to run to the door ... horrified as 
the doors suddenly slam shut. 
 
     SARUMAN (CONT’D) 
  You did not seriously think a Hobbit

  would be wise, my friend. 
 
     GANDALF 
   (deadly) 
  Tell me, friend, when did Saruman the  
  Wise abandon reason for madness? 
 
AT THAT MOMENT: GANDALF is suddenly blasted across the room! He 
slams againt the wall ... pinned there by some unseen force. 
 
With sudden effort, GANDALF wrenches himself off the wall and 
swings his staff on SARUMAN ... blasting him off his feet! 
 
GANDALF and SARUMAN battle, powerful blasts throwing them across 
the room.  
 
SARUMAN SCREAMS, EYES BLAZING! GANDALF’S staff is suddenly 
wrenched from his grasp ... it flies across the chamber into 
SARUMAN’S hand! GANDALF is flung to the floor. 
 
     SARUMAN 
I gave you the choice of aiding me 
willingly, but you have elected the way 
of pain! 
 
GANDALF is breathing hard on the floor, his eye look into the 
madness of SARUMAN...

  What did he say? 
 
     SAM 
  He said...“Don't you leave him,  
  Samwise Gamgee.”  
   (looks at Frodo intently) 
  And I don't mean to. 
 
     FRODO 
   (laughing) 
  Sam ... we're still in the Shire ...  
  what could possibly happen? 
 
SUDDENLY! A figure comes crashing out of a hedgerow sending 
FRODO flying. FRODO picks himself up, only to be knocked back 
down again by PIPPIN. 
 
     PIPPIN 
  Frodo! Merry, it's Frodo Baggins. 
 
     MERRY 
  Hello Frodo! 
 
ANGLE ON: MERRY, PIPPIN, and FRODO picking themselves up ... a 
variety of vegetables have scattered everywhere.

     SAM 
  What’s the meaning of this! 
 
     MERRY 
  Sam, hold this... 
 
MERRY gives SAM a large cabbage. 
 
     SAM 
  You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop! 
 
ANGLE ON: A large pitchfork can be seen racing towards them 
along the HEDGEROW ... angry shouts from FARMER MAGGOT. 
 
  FARMER MAGGOT (O.S.) 
  Who’s that in my field! Get out of it!  
  Get out of my field, you young varmits!  
  I’ll show you ... get out of my corn. 
 
ANGLE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN hurriedly gather their booty and race 
away ... with FRODO and SAM on their heels. 
 
     MERRY 
  I don't know why he is so upset, it's  
  only a couple of carrots. 
 
     PIPPIN 
And some cabbages ... and those three  
bags of potatoes that we lifted last  
week. And the mushrooms the week  
before. 
 
   MERRY 
Yes, Pippin, my point is, he's clearly 
overreacting. 
 
ON THE SOUNDTRACK: The BAYING OF LARGE DOG sounds! 
 
     PIPPIN 
  Run!

EXT. WOODED ROAD - DAY 
 
FRODO, SAM, and MERRY and PIPPIN tumble head over heel down a 
bank, onto a dark, wooded road.

CONTINUED: 
 
CLOSE ON: A winded PIPPIN, his face inches away from a large 
pile of HORSE droppings... 
 
     PIPPIN 
  That was close. 
 
FRODO picks himself up and looks around quickly. 
 
     MERRY 
   (groaning) 
  Ow ... I think I've broken something. 
 
He PULLS a LARGE CARROT, almost broken through in the middle, 
out from his back pocket. 
 
     MERRY (CONT’D) 
  Oh. 
 
     SAM 
   (turning on Merry and Pippin) 
  Trust a Brandybuck and a Took! 
 
     MERRY 
  What? That was just a detour ... 
  a short cut. 
 
     SAM 
  A shortcut to what? 
 
PIPPIN has spied something under the trees on the far side of 
the road. 
 
     PIPPIN 
   (excited) 
  Mushrooms! 
 
CLOSE ON: SMALL, brown mushrooms growing amongst the LOAMY 
undergrowth. SAM, MERRY, and PIPPIN race toward the mushrooms! 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO is tense and watchful. He realizes they are on a 
wooded road. Scattered leaves rise into the air WHIRLING down 
the road as if blown by an invisible wind... 
 
SUDDENLY ... THE SOUND OF HORSE HOOVES... 
 
     FRODO 
  I think we should get off the road. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
56. 
 
 
CONTINUED: (2) 
 
A long drawn WAIL comes down the wind, like the cry of some evil 
and lovely creature. 
 
     FRODO (CONT’D) 
   (more urgency) 
  Get off the road! 
 
SAM grabs MERRY and PIPPIN as the HOBBITS quickly scramble down 
the bank, hiding under a mossy log. 
 
THE SOUND OF HOOVES is close ... a sinister MOUNTED RINGWRAITH 
steps into view ... hooded and faceless, mounted on a huge 
snarling black horse with insane eyes!  
 
FRODO freezes in terror. 
 
ANGLE ON: The RINGWRAITH pauses right beside their hiding place 
... he sits very still with head bowed, listening. From inside 
the hood comes a sniffing noise as if he is trying to catch an 
elusive scent: he head turning from side to side. 
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO ... beads of sweat gather on his brow 
 
ANGLE ON: The RINGWRAITH suddenly slides off his horse, leaning 
over the mossy log, peering suspiciously into the woods. 
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO ... he is drawing the RING out of his pocket, 
with trembling hands ... his face fevered and sweating as if in 
the grip of some terrible INTERNAL STRUGGLE.  
 
The SOUND OF SNIFFING intensifies as the RINGWRAITH darts his 
head from side to side like a bird of prey. 
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO SQUEEZING HIS EYES SHUT... 
 
QUICK PSYCHIC BLASTS! AN EVIL DARK TOWER ... A GREAT EYE ... A 
BURST OF FLAME. 
 
ANGLE ON: SAM LOOKING AT FRODO WITH CONCERN. 
 
     SAM 
  Frodo? 
 
MERRY desperately hurls the mushrooms across the road ... the 
RINGWRAITH spins around at the sound, and darts to the far side 
of the road with frightening speed. 
 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
57. 
 
 
CONTINUED: (3) 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO instantly slumps ... as if a PSYCHIC LINK had 
been broken... 
 
     MERRY 
  What was that? 
 
FRODO is staring, a look of shock on his face at the RING lying 
in the palm of his hand. 
 
EXT. FERRY LANE - NIGHT 
 
FRODO, SAM, MERRY, and PIPPIN hurry through the trees ... 
slipping and sliding on the muddy ground. 
 
     SAM 
  Anything? 
 
     FRODO 
  Nothing. 
 
     PIPPIN 
  What is going on? 
 
ANGLE ON: MERRY moves past PIPPIN, toward FRODO, watching 
intently ... SAM keeps looking around nervously. 
 
     MERRY 
  That Black Rider was looking for  
  something ... or someone ... Frodo? 
 
     SAM 
  Get down! 
 
ANGLE ON: The SILHOUETTE OF A BLACK RIDER looms against the 
skyline.  
 
ANGLE ON: The FOUR HOBBITS ... sprawled on the ground, holding 
their breath.  
 
ANGLE ON: The BLACK RIDER turns and departs. 
 
     FRODO 
  I have to leave the Shire. Sam and 
  I must get to Bree. 
 
ANGLE ON: MERRY looks at his friend ... realizing FRODO is in 
deep trouble.

The HOBBITS break cover.  
 
SUDDENLY, A RINGWRAITH bursts out of the forest TOWARD THEM! 
 
     MERRY (CONT’D) 
  There’s another one!! Frodo, this way!! 
 
The HOBBITS run ... THE RINGWRAITH SHRIEKS! 
 
QUICK CUTS: Black horse hooves ... snarling horse mouths ... a 
fleeting black cowl. 
 
     MERRY (CONT’D) 
  Frodo, follow me! 
 
      CUT TO: 
 
EXT. BUCKLEBERRY FERRY - NIGHT 
 
FRODO, SAM, MERRY, and PIPPIN are running towards the wide, 
placid BRANDYWINE RIVER ... and the FERRY. 
 
     MERRY 
  Get the ropes, Sam. 
 
QUICK ANGLES: STOMPING HOOVES ... SNARLING HORSES... 
 
Four RINGWRAITHS are speeding through the FOG ... converging on 
the FERRY CROSSING. The HOBBITS stampede across the WHARF and 
TUMBLE onto the FERRY. 
  
     SAM 
   (screaming) 
  Frodo! 
 
FRODO races across the WOODEN WHARF, followed by the 
RINGWRAITHS. He leaps onto the FERRY. 
 
CLOSE ON: HOOVES THUNDER DOWN THE WOODEN WHARF! 
 
SAM and MERRY shove off with the poles ... the ferry slides out 
into the river, just as the RINGWRAITHS arrive. They pull up on 
the end of the wharf ... shrieking with rage! The HOBBITS cover 
their ears. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
59. 
 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
The RINGWRAITHS wheel their horses towards the north and GALLOP 
away along the river bank, quickly disappearing into the fog. 
 
     FRODO 
  Where is the nearest crossing? 
 
     MERRY 
  The Brandywine bridge ... twenty miles. 
 
      CUT TO: 
 
EXT. BREE GATE - NIGHT 
 
ANGLE ON: Lights of BREE ... a small village of stone and half- 
timbered houses nestled against a low wooded hill. A thick hedge 
surrounds the village ... a great gate bars the western 
entrance.  
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO, SAM, MERRY, AND PIPPIN approaching the 
gatehouse ... wild eyes, ragged, and out of breath. 
 
     FRODO 
  Come on. 
 
ANGLE ON: A SURLY GATEKEEPER, OLD HARRY, glances down at them. 
 
     OLD HARRY 
  What do you want? 
 
     FRODO 
  We are headed for the Prancing Pony. 
 
OLD HARRY swings his lantern onto the HOBBITS, bathing them in 
an uncomfortable yellow spotlight. 
 
     OLD HARRY 
  Hobbits! Four Hobbits, and what’s more, 
  out of the Shire by your talk. What  
  business brings you to Bree? 
 
     FRODO 
  We wish to stay at the inn ... our  
  business is our own. 
 
To FRODO’S relief, OLD HARRY unlocks the gate. 
 
     OLD HARRY 
  All right, young sir, I meant no  
  offense.  
      (CONTINUED) 
60.

The HOBBITS gratefully enter BREE .. OLD HARRY eyeing them 
curiously in the lantern light.  
 
     OLD HARRY 
  ‘Tis Old Harry’s job to ask questions  
  after nightfall. There's talk of  
  strange folk abroad ... can't be too  
  careful.

EXT. BREE STREETS - NIGHT 
 
The tall BREE FOLK loom over the nervous LITTLE HOBBITS as 
FRODO, SAM, MERRY, and PIPPIN make their way through the NARROW 
STREETS. Tall buildings tower above them ... light glow dimly 
from behind thick curtains. 
 
CLOSE ON: The sign of the “PRANCING PONY INN” ... FRODO, SAM, 
MERRY, and PIPPIN hurry toward it. 
 
INT. “PRANCING PONY” RECEPTION - NIGHT 
 
FRODO, SAM, MERRY, and PIPPIN come rushing in. FRODO attracts 
the INN KEEPER’s attention. 
 
     FRODO 
  Excuse me. 
 
     BUTTERBUR 
Good evening, little masters. If you're 
seeking accommodation, we’ve got some 
nice, cozy Hobbit sized rooms 
available. Mr...ah... 
 
   FRODO 
Underhill ... my name's Underhill.  
 
   BUTTERBUR 
Underhill? Hmmmm. 
 
   FRODO 
We're friends of Gandalf the Grey... 
Can you tell him we've arrived? 
 
BUTTERBUR frowns...

   BUTTERBUR 
 (puzzled) 
Gandalf ... Gandalf ... Oh...  
 (recognition) 
Oh, yes! I remember ... elderly chap 
... big grey beard ... pointy hat?  
 
BUTTERBUR shakes his head. 
 
   BUTTERBUR (CONT’D) 
Not seen him for six months. 
 
FRODO is shocked. 
 
   SAM 
 (worried whisper) 
What do we do now? 
 
INT. PRANCING PONY - LATER 
 
WIDE ON: the noisy, smokey INN. It is dimly lit, shiefly from a 
blazing log fire ... and crowded with a mixture of BIG FOLK, 
LOCAL HOBBITS, and a couple of dwarfs. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO, SAM, MERRY, and PIPPIN are sitting at a table 
against the wall ... clearly trying to remain QUIET and 
inconspicuous ... SAM can’t help himself ... he keeps casting 
nervous glances around. 
 
   FRODO 
Sam, he'll be here. He’ll come. 
 
ANGLE ON: MERRY ploinks himself down at a table, carrying a very 
large mug of beer. 
 
     PIPPIN 
  What's that? 
 
     MERRY 
  This, my friend, is a pint. 
 
     PIPPIN 
  It comes in pints? I'm getting one. 
 
SAM watches PIPPIN rise unsteadily to his feet and head to the 
bar. 
 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
62. 
 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
     SAM 
  You've got a whole half already! 
 
MERRY watches PIPPIN go. 
 
ANGLE ON: A COUPLE OF SWARTHY MEN leaning against the bar glance 
at FRODO, then quickly look away. 
 
     SAM (CONT’D) 
   (tense) 
  That fellow's done nothing but stare  
  at you since we arrived. 
 
SAM indicates a BROODING STRANGER who sits alone at a table in 
the far corner, smoking a curiously carved long stemmed pipe, 
peering from beneath a travel stained cowl with gleaming eyes.  
 
FRODO gestures to BUTTERBUR. 
 
     FRODO 
  Excuse me, that Man in the corner,  
  who is he? 
 
     BUTTERBUR 
  He's one of them Rangers; they’re  
  dangerous folk they are, wandering the  
  wilds. What his right name is, I never  
  heard, but round here he's known as  
  Strider. 
 
     FRODO 
   (to himself) 
  Strider. 
 
BENEATH TABLE: FRODO’S fingers are nervously TOYING WITH THE 
RING. 
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO ... Sweat runs down his brow. The STRANGE HUM OF 
THE RING spills into the SOUNDTRACK. 
 
“Baggins ... Baggins...” a creepy whisper seems to fill FRODO’S 
head ... sound that dissolves into PIPPIN’S loud voice: 
 
     PIPPIN 
  Baggins? Sure I know a Baggins. He’s  
  over there... 
 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
63. 
 
 
CONTINUED: (2) 
 
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN sitting at the bar, chatting with LOCALS. FRODO 
leaps to his feet and pushes his way to the bar. 
 
     PIPPIN (CONT’D) 
  Frodo Baggins. He's my second cousin,  
  once removed on his mother's side  
  and my third cousin, twice removed on  
  his father’s side ... if you follow me. 
 
FRODO grabs PIPPIN’S sleeve, spilling his beer. 
 
     FRODO 
  Pippin! 
 
     PIPPIN 
  Steady on, Frodo! 
 
PIPPIN pushes FRODO away ... he stumbles backwards, and falls to 
the floor.  
 
AT THAT INSTANT, the INN goes silent and all the attentionturns 
to FRODO... 
 
CLOSE ON: THE RING ... in agonizing SLOW MOTION ... we watch as 
it seems to hang in the air for a split second ... then crashes 
down onto his outstretched finger. 
 
FRODO VANISHES! 
 
There is a sharp intake of breath followed by total silence. 
 
      CUT TO: 
 
EXT. BREE COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT 
 
THE RINGWRAITHS turn sharply in their saddles ... INSTANTLY 
aware that the RING is being worn. They spur their horses 
towards the distant lights of BREE.  
 
INT. “PRANCING PONY” INN - NIGHT 
 
SAM looks sick; PIPPIN instantly sobers, realizing his folly; 
the brooding stranger frowns ... and the INN erupts into excited 
babble.

IN THE TWILIGHT WORLD: 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO, as he finds himself in the TWILIGHT WORLD of 
the RING: THE EXCITED CROWD are suddenly moving in SLOW MOTION 
... distorted voices ... a weird photographic negative quality. 
FRODO is moving in real time; against the slow motion 
background.  
 
He suddenly clutches his head as he is hit with QUICK IMAGES ... 
of a GREAT EYE! AN EVIL CAT-LIKE EYE, WREATHED IN FLAMES. 
 
     VOICE OF SAURON 
  You cannot hide ... I see you ... 
  There is no life here in the void ... 
  only cold ... only death. 
 
FRODO is terrified! He rolls under a table, desperately pulling 
the RING from his finger. 
 
FRODO MATERIALIZES into the REAL WORLD. 
 
AT THAT MOMENT: A LARGE HAND reaches under the table and GRABS 
FRODO by the collar, and DRAGS HIM AWAY! 
 
      CUT TO: 
 
INT. PRANCING PONY - CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
 
FRODO is roughly pushed against the wall. The BROODING STRANGER 
looms over him.

  You draw far too much attention to  
  yourself ... Mr. Underhill. 
 
      CUT TO: 
 
INT. HOBBIT’S ROOM, PRANCING PONY  - NIGHT 
 
FRODO is pushed into the HOBBIT’S ROOM by STRIDER. 
    
     FRODO 
  What do you want? 
 
     STRIDER 
  A little more caution from you ... that  
  is no trinket you carry. 
 
     FRODO 
  I carry nothing. 
      (CONTINUED) 
65. 
 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
     STRIDER 
  Indeed? I can avoid being seen if I  
  wish, but to disappear entirely ...  
  that is a rare gift. 
 
He takes down the hood of his cloak to reveal a shaggy head of 
dark hair flecked with grey, and in a pale stern face a pair of 
keen grey eyes. 
 
     FRODO 
  Who are you? 
 
     STRIDER 
  Are you frightened? 
 
     FRODO 
  Yes.  
 
     STRIDER 
  Not nearly frightened enough. I  
  know what hunts you. 
 
FRODO jumps at the sound of a noise in the corridor. STRIDER 
deftly draws his sword. 
 
ANGLE ON: The door BURSTS OPEN and SAM, MERRY, and PIPPIN appear 
on the doorway. SAM is squaring off with his FISTS, MERRY 
brandishes a CANDELABRA, and PIPPIN a CHAIR.  
 
     SAM 
  Let him go or I’ll have you, Longshanks! 
 
STRIDER SHEATHS his sword, a slight smile playing on his lips. 
 
     STRIDER 
  You have a stout heart, little Hobbit,  
  but that alone will not save you ...   you can no 
  Frodo. They’re coming.

INT. STRIDER’S ROOM - NIGHT 
 
WIDE ON: SAM, MERRY, and PIPPIN have been sleeping on STRIDER’S 
bed. FRODO stands next to STRIDER by the window, peering out 
nervously as furious RINGWRAITH screeches echo across the 
courtyard from the HOBBIT’S ROOM. 
 
     FRODO 
  What are they? 
 
     STRIDER 
They were once Men.  
 
ANGLE ON: STRIDER glances quickly at FRODO, then looks away... 
 
   STRIDER (CONT’D) 
 (quietly) 
Great kings of Men. Then Sauron the 
Deceiver gave to them Nine Rings of 
Power. Blinded by their greed they took 
them without question, one by one 
falling into darkness. Now they are 
slaves to his will.  
 
STRIDER looks from the window as the RINGWRAITHS gallop down the 
BREE STREETS. 
 
CLOSE ON: STRIDER turns back to the HOBBITS, his face lit 
faintly by the GLOWING EMBERS of the FIRE. 
 
   STRIDER (CONT’D) 
They are the Nazgûl, Ringwraiths, 
neither living nor dead. At all times 
they feel the presence of the Ring ... 
drawn to the power of the One ... They 
will never stop hunting you.

gloomy overgrown forest. SAM follows at the rear leading BILL, a 
SCRAWNY PONY, who is laden with supplies. 
 
     FRODO 
  Where are you taking us? 
 
     STRIDER 
  Into the Wild. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO watches uneasily as STRIDER moves off into the 
cover of trees... 
 
     MERRY 
   (whispered aside) 
  How do we know this Strider is a  
  friend of Gandalf? 
 
     FRODO 
  I think a servant of the enemy  
  would look fairer and feel fouler. 
   
     MERRY 
  He’s foul enough. 
 
     FRODO 
  We have no choice but to trust him. 
 
     SAM 
  But where is he leading us? 
 
STRIDER stops, casts a glance back at SAM. 
 
     STRIDER 
  To Rivendell, Master Gamgee ... to the  
  house of Elrond. 
 
SAM looks excited. 
 
     SAM 
  Did you hear that, Bill? Rivendell! 
  We're going to see the Elves!

  Gentlemen, we do not stop till  
  nightfall. 
 
     PIPPIN 
  What about breakfast? 
 
     STRIDER 
  You’ve already had it. 
 
     PIPPIN 
  We've had one, yes ... what about  
  second breakfast? 
 
ANGLE ON: STRIDER stares at PIPPIN blankly, then turns away, 
shaking his head. 
 
     MERRY 
  I don't think he knows about second  
  breakfast, Pip. 
 
     PIPPIN 
  What about Elevenses, Luncheon,  
  Afternoon tea, dinner ... he knows  
  about them, doesn’t he? 
 
     MERRY 
  I wouldn't count on it. 
 
An apple is thrown to MERRY, who deftly catches it. Another, 
aimed at PIPPIN, catches him on the forehead. 
 
     MERRY (CONT’D) 
   (exasperated) 
  Pippin!

 Tinúviel elvanui,  
 Elleth alfirin ethelhael  
 O hon ring finnil fuinui  
 A renc gelebrin thiliol.  
 
 Tinúviel the elven-fair,  
 Immortal maiden elven-wise,  
 About him cast her night-dark hair, 
 And arms like silver glimmering. 
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO awakens, hearing Strider’s song. 
 
   FRODO 
 Who is she? This woman you sing of? 
 
ANGLE ON: STRIDER turns, momentarily startled. He relaxes 
quickly. He speaks as if the tale is personal to him. 
 
   STRIDER 
 ‘Tis the lady of Lúthien. The  
 Elf-maiden who gave her love to  
 Beren, a mortal. 
 
   FRODO 
 What happened to her?

FRODO nods and lays back down.  
 
STRIDER turns back to his vigil and looks up at the moon. His 
eyes are brimming with tears.

  The power of Isengard is at your command,  
  Sauron, Lord of the Earth. 
 
ON THE SOUNDTRACK: BLACK SPEECH FILLS THE ROOM ... AMIDST THE

GANDALF stands as the CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL HIM stranded 
on the SUMMIT OF ORTHANC. He is marooned on the tiny, flat peak, 
surrounded on all sides by a sheer 500 FOOT DROP. 
 
Another whispering wail rends the air. GANDALF crosses quickly 
to the edge and peers down: 
 
POV: One of the beautiful ISENGARD trees is being ripped from 
the ground by the ORCS. GANDALF looks on in HORROR as ORCS hack 
into the trunk with axes. 
 
ANGLE ON: SARUMAN stands in RAIN looking out into the dark night 
... the ORC OVERSEER sidles up to him, axe in hand, sweating 
with exertion. 
 
     ORC OVERSEER 
  The trees are strong, my Lord.  
  Their roots go deep. 
 
     SARUMAN 
  Rip them all down.

SAUSAGES and BACON sizzle in a hot frying pan. 
 
     FRODO 
  What are you doing? 
 
     MERRY 
  Tomatoes, sausages, and crispy bacon. 
 
     SAM 
  We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo. 
 
     FRODO 
  Put it out, you fools! put it out! 
 
     PIPPIN 
  Oh, that's nice ... ash on my tomatoes! 
 
A SUDDEN SHRIEK!

unnaturally fast.

The HOBBITS stand back-to-back in the centre of the RING, 
waiting for the first assault... 
 
ANGLE ON: One by one, the 5 RINGWRAITHS appear ... brandishing 
GLEAMING SWORDS, they move slowly towards the HOBBITS. In the 
center is their leader ... the WITCH KING! 
 
     SAM 
  Back, you devils! 
 
ANGLE ON: SAM rushes forward with a cry. He swings his sword at 
the WITCH KING, who blocks the blow with his own sword. SAM’S 
blade shatters ... the WITCH KING lashes out with his fist, 
sending SAM flying. 
 
ANGLE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN, overcome with terror, throw 
themselves flat on the ground.  
 
ANGLE ON: The RINGWRAITHS close in on FRODO ... a VENOMOUS 
WHISPER dances in his head... 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO shuts his eyes and staggers back, desperately 
resisting the WRAITH’S WHISPERINGS ... SLOW MOTION as his hand 
goes into his pocket and pulls out the RING. The 5 RINGWRAITHS 
utter a chilling SCREECH OF EXCITEMENT. FRODO is unable to 
resist any longer, falls to his knees and slips on the RING. He 
DISAPPEARS. 
 
     SAM (CONT’D) 
  No! 
 
IN THE TWILIGHT WORLD: 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO finds himself in the weird TWILIGHT WORLD ... he 
looks upon the RINGWRAITHS, now visible in their TRUE 
APPEARANCE: FIVE GHOULS dressed in long GREY ROBES, with white 
hair, and PALLID ruthless faces. 
 
THE WITCH KING extends a haggard hand towards FRODO, reaching 
for the RING on his finger. FRODO’S trembling hand extends 
forward, as if by the pull of the RING ... he slides to the 
ground, unable to pull his hand away. 
 
The WITCH KING snarls and springs forward. He stabs at FRODO 
with a wicked DAGGER! FRODO winces as the tip of the dagger 
sinks into his shoulder.

SUDDENLY, STRIDER charges at the RINGWRAITHS, wielding his sword 
in one hand, a FLAMING TORCH in the other. He moves in SLOW 
MOTION, visible through a sea of mist.  
 
FRODO sinks to the ground. Behind him is a faint image of a 
RINGWRAITH fleeing, his head engulfed in flames. With draining 
strength, FRODO manages to pull the RING off his finger... 
 
IN THE REAL WORLD: ...APPEARING back in the real world, SAM 
rushes over to him. 
 
     SAM (CONT’D) 
   (horrified) 
  Frodo! 
 
Another RINGWRAITH is burning and screaming ... others screech 
fearfully at the flames, turn and flee from the WEATHERTOP 
SUMMIT. 
 
     SAM (CONT’D) 
   (panicked) 
  Mr. Frodo!! 
 
STRIDER kneels before FRODO. He snatches up the WITCH KING’S 
DAGGER from the ground, staring gravely at the long, thin, 
blade. 
 
     SAM (CONT’D) 
  Help him, Strider!  
 
     STRIDER 
   (grim) 
  He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.  
 
The MORGUL BLADE suddenly melts ... vanishing into the air like 
smoke. STRIDER throws the hilt down in disgust... 
 
     SAM 
  Do something. 
 
     STRIDER 
  This is beyond my skill to heal.  
   (urgently) 
  He needs Elvish medicine. 
 
STRIDER lifts FRODO onto his shoulders.

EXT. WEATHERHILLS - NIGHT 
 
STRIDER is jogging grimly, carrying an ailing FRODO on his back. 
SAM, MERRY, and PIPPIN are running to keep up. The HOBBITS are 
carrying FLAMING TORCHES for protection. 
 
     STRIDER 
  Hurry! 
 
     SAM 
  We are six days from Rivendell. 
 
FRODO groans.

gleaming in the moonlight.  
 
CAMERA RISES TO REVEAL the once beautiful gardens are now a 
pitted wasteland ... with smoke and fire billowing out of 
numerous tunnels and vent holes that littler the forecourt of 
ORTHANC. Strange guttural chants echo up from deep underground. 
 
THE CAMERA IS RISING ... a SMALL MOTH flutters into SHOT ... and 
LEADS THE CAMERA towards the SUMMIT OF ORTHANC.  
 
GANDALF lies slumped against the wall at the very top of ORTHANC 
surrounded by a sheer 500 FOOT DROP. He looks WEAK and FRAIL ... 
and is seemingly asleep. 
 
His hand suddenly moves at lightning speed and SNATCHES THE 
MOTH. GANDALF brings his hand close to his face and opens it. 
The MOTH sits on the palm of his hand as GANDALF mutters strange 
words in a foreign tongue. 
 
CLOSE ON: THE MOTH’S face ... seemingly listening. It suddenly 
flutters away.

     SAM 
  Look, Frodo. It’s Mr. Bilbo’s

ANGLE ON: SAM feels of his skin. 
 
     SAM 
  Mr. Frodo? He's going cold! 
 
     PIPPIN 
  Is he going to die? 
 
FRODO’S breathing is getting shallow. STRIDER loks out into the 
darkness. 
 
     STRIDER 
  He is passing into the Shadow World.  
  He’ll soon become a Wraith like them. 
 
A DISTANT CRY of a RINGWRAITH carries through the air.

     FRODO (CONT’D) 
  This is wonderful. 
 
     BILBO 
I meant to go back ... wander the paths 
of Mirkwood, visit Laketown, see the 
Lonely Mountain again ... but age, it 
seems, has finally caught up with me. 
 
FRODO turns a page ... there before him, is a map of the SHIRE. 
 
   FRODO 
 (quietly) 
I miss the Shire ... I spent all 
my childhood pretending I was off 
somewhere else ... off with you, 
on one of your adventures...  
 (looks at Bilbo) 
But my own adventure turned out to 
be quite different ... I'm not 
like you, Bilbo. 
 
   BILBO 
My dear boy.

SAM busily tries to stuff more and more things into his already 
full pack ... pots and pans, blankets, cooking utensils, 
provisions, clothes. 
 
   SAM 
Now, what have I forgotten?

Packed already?

 (slightly embarrassed) 
No harm in being prepared. 
 
FRODO strolls to the edge of the BALCONY. 
 
   FRODO 
I thought you wanted to see the 
Elves, Sam? 
 
   SAM 
I do... 
 
   FRODO 
More than anything. 
 
   SAM 
I did. It’s just... We did what  
Gandalf wanted, didn't we? We got the 
Ring this far, to Rivendell ... and I 
thought ... seeing as how you're on the 
mend, we'd be off soon. Off home. 
 
   FRODO 
You're right, Sam... 
 
FRODO looks at SAM... 
 
   FRODO (CONT’D) 
...we did what we set out to do.  
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO opens his hand, the RING sits in his PALM.

The Ring will be safe in Rivendell. I 
am ready to go home.

     GANDALF 
  That wound will never fully heal. He  
  will carry it the rest of his life. 
 
     ELROND 
  Yet to have come so far still bearing  
  the Ring ... the Hobbit has shown  
  extraordinary resilience to its evil. 
 
     GANDALF 
  It is a burden he should never have 
  had to bear. We can ask no more of 
  Frodo. 
 
     ELROND 
  Gandalf, the enemy is moving. Sauron's  
  forces are massing in the East. His Eye  
  is fixed on Rivendell. And Saruman, you  
  tell me, has betrayed us. Our list of  
  allies grows thin. 
 
     GANDALF 
  His treachery runs deeper than you  
  know. By foul craft, Saruman has  
  crossed Orcs with Goblin Men ... He’s  
  breeding an army in the caverns of  
  Isengard. An army that can move in  
  Sunlight and cover great distance at  
  speed. Saruman is coming for the Ring. 
 
ELROND turns and walks away... 
 
     ELROND 
  This evil cannot be concealed by the  
  power of the Elves... We do not have  
  the strength to fight both Mordor and  
  Isengard ... Gandalf ... the Ring 
  cannot stay here. 
 
GANDALF turns and looks out the window. 
 
ANGLES ON: Sounds of arrivals ... GANDALF watches as BOROMIR 
rides through the RIVENDELL gate, followed by LEGOLAS and GIMLI.

     ELROND (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
  The time of the Elves is over. My  
  people are leaving these shores. Who  
  will you look to when we’ve gone? The  
  Dwarves? They hide in their mountains  
  seeking riches. They care nothing for  
  the troubles of others. 
 
     GANDALF 
  It is in Men that we must place our 
  hope. 
 
     ELROND 
  Men? Men are weak. The race of Men is  
  failing. The blood of Númenor is all  
  but spent, its pride and dignity  
  forgotten. It is because of Men the  
  Ring survives.  
 
FLASH INSERT: With the broken sword, ISILDUR slices off SAURON’S 
finger. ELROND reacts. 
 
     ELROND (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
  I was there, Gandalf. I was there three  
  thousand years ago when Isildur took  
  the Ring. 
 
FLASH INSERT: ISILDUR PICKS UP THE RING AND STARES AT IT, 
ENTRANCED.

INT. ELROND’S CHAMBER, RIVENDELL - DAY 
 
ANGLE ON: ELROND turns to GANDALF. 
 
     ELROND 
  It should have ended that day, but evil  
  was allowed to endure. Isildur kept the  
  Ring ... and the line of kings was  
  broken. There’s no strength left in the  
  world of Men. They are scattered,  
  divided, leaderless. 
 
     GANDALF 
  There is one who could unite them, one  
  who could reclaim the throne of Gondor.  
 
     ELROND 
  He turned from that path a long time  
  ago. He has chosen exile.

ANGLE ON: STRIDER watches from the shadows ... as BOROMIR  
strolls through the darkened gallery. BOROMIR’S eyes are drawn  
to an old FRESCO on the wall ... depicting ISILDUR defeating 
SAURON. 
 
BOROMIR turns suddenly and notices STRIDER, looking at him. He 
looks STRIDER up and down, confused for a moment.

  Who are you? 
 
     STRIDER 
  I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey. 
 
BOROMIR nods, understanding Strider’s vagueness. 
 
     BOROMIR 
  Then we are here on common purpose ...  
  friend. 
 
BOROMIR smiles uncomfortably. STRIDER only looks at him 
silently. 
 
BOROMIR looks with WONDERMENT at NARSIL, the BROKEN BLADE of 
ELENDIL, which lies on a cloth-covered plinth. 
 
     BOROMIR (CONT’D) 
   (quiet awe) 
  The shards of Narsil ... the blade that  
  cut the Ring from Sauron's hand. 
 
BOROMIR picks up the sword and gently touches the blade. 
 
CLOSE ON: a small bloom of blood appears on BOROMIR’S  
finger... 
 
     BOROMIR (CONT’D) 
  Still sharp.  
 
He slowly looks over to STRIDER, as if sensing a connection.  
 
     BOROMIR (CONT’D) 
  But no more than a broken heirloom. 
 
BOROMIR replaces the blade, but it clatters to the floor.  
BOROMIR walks away, leaving STRIDER sitting alone.

Three Rings for the Elven-kings 
under the sky, 
Seven for the Dwarf-lords in their 
halls of stone, 
Nine for Mortal Men doomed to die, 
One for the Dark Lord on his dark 
throne 
In the Land of Mordor where the 
Shadows lie. 
One Ring to rule them all. One 
Ring to find them,  
One Ring to bring them all 
together and in the darkness bind 
them, 
  In the Land of Mordor where the 
  Shadows lie. 
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO opens his hand ... the RING lies in his palm. He 
looks up. 
 
ANGLE ON: ELROND addresses the COUNCIL... 
 
     ELROND 
  Strangers from distant lands ...  
  friends of old. You have been summoned  
  here to answer the threat of Mordor.  
  Middle-Earth stands upon the brink of  
  destruction. None can escape it.  You  
  will unite ... or you will fall. Each  
  race is bound to this fate ... this one  
  doom... 
 
FRODO sits amongst a council of FREE-PEOPLES of Middle earth, 
ELROND stands before them, addressing GANDALF, STRIDER, LEGOLAS, 
and 20 other ELVES, DWARVES, and MEN. 
 
     ELROND (CONT’D) 
  Bring forth the Ring, Frodo. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO steps forward and moves towards a stone PLINTH.

     BOROMIR 
  In a dream, I saw the eastern sky grow  
  dark, but in the West a pale light  
  lingered. A voice was crying: “Your  
  doom is near at hand. Isildur’s Bane is  
  found.” 
 
ANGLE ON: ELROND and GANDALF exchange glances. BOROMIR reaches 
for the RING.

      GANDALF 
  I do not ask your pardon, Master   
  Elrond, for the Black Speech of Mordor  
  may yet be heard in every corner of the  
  West! The Ring is altogether evil.  
 
ANGLE ON: GANDALF returns to his seat.  
 
ANGLE ON: BOROMIR shakes his head. He stands again to make his 
case to the COUNCIL. 
 
     BOROMIR 
  It is a gift ... a gift to the foes of  
  Mordor! Why not use this Ring? Long has  
  my father, the Steward of Gondor, kept  
  the forces of Mordor at bay ... by the  
  blood of our people are your lands kept  
  safe. Give Gondor the weapon of the  
  enemy ... let us use it against him! 
 
     STRIDER 
  You cannot wield it. None of us can.  
  The One Ring answers to Sauron alone  
  ... it has no other master.  
 
ANGLE ON: BOROMIR turns and looks at STRIDER, coolly. 
 
     BOROMIR 
  And what would a Ranger know of this  
  matter? 
 
STRIDER says nothing and BOROMIR turns away dismissively. 
 
ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS stands...

  And heir to the throne of Gondor.

  Havo dad, Legolas... 
 
  Sit down, Legolas...

  Gondor has no king.  
 
     GANDALF 
  Aragorn is right ... we cannot use it. 
 
     ELROND 
  You have only one choice ... the Ring 
  must be destroyed. 
 
ON THE SOUNDTRACK: The HUM OF THE RING seems to grow louder in 
FRODO’S ears.  
 
ANGLE ON: GIMLI suddenly stands, excited. 
 
     GIMLI 
  Then ... what are we waiting for? 
 
GIMLI suddenly rushes forward! He swings his axe down on the 
RING. The axe SHATTERS with a deafening CRACK! GIMLI falls 
backwards staring in disbelief at the RING ... unharmed! 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO winces as an angry IMAGE of the FIERY EYE hits 
him! He slumps in his chair, clutching his forehead. GANDALF 
looks at him with concern. 
 
     ELROND 
  The Ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli,  
  son of Glóin, by any craft that we here  
  possess. The Ring was made in the fires  
  of Mount Doom ... only there can it be  
  unmade.

STUNNED SILENCE ... the council sits with downcast eyes, as if a 
great dread has descended upon them. 
 
BOROMIR addresses the council in a quiet voice. 
 
     BOROMIR 
  One does not simply walk into Mordor.  
  Its Black Gates are guarded by more  
  than just Orcs. There is evil there  
  that does not sleep and the Great Eye  
  is ever watchful. It is a barren  
  wasteland riddled with fire, and ash  
  and dust ... the very air you breathe  
  is a poisonous fume. Not with ten  
  thousand Men could you do this. It is  
  folly. 
 
     LEGOLAS 
  Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has  
  said? The Ring must be destroyed. 
 
     GIMLI 
  And I suppose you think you're the 
  one to do it? 
 
     BOROMIR 
  And what if we fail, what then? What  
  happens when Sauron takes back what is  
  his? 
 
GIMLI leaps to his feet! 
 
     GIMLI 
  I will be dead before I see the Ring in  
  the hands of an Elf!  
 
A STORM OF ARGUMENT erupts around the room.

  Never trust an Elf!

across the surface ... flames flicker within the GOLD BAND. 
 
     GANDALF 
  Do you not understand? While we bicker  
  amongst ourselves, Sauron’s power  
  grows! No one will escape it. You will  
  all be destroyed, with your homes burnt  
  and your families put to the sword! 
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO ... breathing rapidly, CAUGHT in the grip of his 
hideous vision. With a huge effort of will, FRODO tears his gaze 
upon the RING.  
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO suddenly stands ... he speaks in a strong, clear 
voice. 
 
     FRODO 
  I will take it ... I will take it ...  
  I will take the Ring to Mordor.

  are not.

     ELROND 
  In her heart, your mother knew you’d be

  on. 
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO peels off his SHIRT ... revealing the RING on 
the CHAIN around his neck. 
 
     BILBO (CONT’D) 
   (entranced) 
  Oh! My old Ring...  
 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
105. 
 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
FRODO frowns as BILBO moves toward him. 
 
     BILBO (CONT’D) 
  I should very much like to hold it again,  
  one last time. 
 
BILBO reaches forward, eyes locked on the RING. 
 
ANGLE ON: SUDDENLY! A SHADOW passes across BILBO ... for a split 
second he becomes a WRINKLED CREATURE with a HUNGRY FACE and 
BONY, GROPING HANDS.  
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO pulls away, shocked... 
 
ANGLE ON: THE SHADOW passes... BILBO slumps into a chair, his 
head in his hands. BILBO falters ... his eyes filling with 
tears. 
 
     BILBO (CONT’D) 
  Oh! 
   (sad) 
  I'm sorry, that I brought this upon  
  you, my boy. I'm sorry that you must 
  carry this burden. I'm sorry for 
  everything. 
 
BILBO sobs and FRODO moves to comfort him. 
 
      CUT TO: 
 
EXT. RIVENDELL TERRACE - DAY 
 
ANGLE ON: ELROND and FRODO walk towards the rest of the 
FELLOWSHIP waiting at the Gate of RIVENDELL. 
 
     ELROND 
  The time has come for the Ring to set  
  out. You cannot count on your journey  
  being aided by war or force. You will  
  pass into the domain of the Enemy far  
  from aid. Do you still hold to your  
  word Frodo, that you will be the 
  Ring-bearer? 
 
     FRODO 
  I do. I must. I will go with Sam. 
 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
106. 
 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
     ELROND 
  Then I cannot help you much, not even  
  with counsel. I can foresee very little 
  of your road; and how your task is to   be achieve 
  Mountains, and draws nigh even to the  
  borders of  the Greyflood; and under the  
  Shadow all is dark to me. You will meet  
  many foes, some open, and some  
  disguised; and you may find friends  
  upon your way when you least look for   
  it. I will send out messages, such as I  
  can contrive, to those whom I know in  
  the wide world; but so perilous have  
  the lands now become that some may well  
  miscarry, or come no quicker than you 
  yourself. Had I a host of Elves in  
  armor of the Elder Days, it would  
  avail little, save to arouse the  
  power of Mordor. Are you confident  
  in your companions? 
 
     FRODO 
  Yes, Lord Elrond. I must be, I’m  
  afraid, for if I doubt them, we may  
  never succeed. 
 
     ELROND 
  And what of your Hobbit friends? I had  
  hoped to send them back to the Shire as  
  messengers to warn the people of the  
  impending danger according to the  
  fashion of your country. I feel that  
  the youngest, Peregrin Took, should not  
  go with you. My heart is against it.  
 
     FRODO 
  His heart is set upon going. There will  
  be no stopping him, even if you did  
  send him home in a sack. 
 
     ELROND 
  Let it be so then. The Fellowship awaits. 
 
WIDE ON: ELROND and FRODO turn a corner and descend to the 
FELLOWSHIP, now waiting by the gate. 
 
107. 
 
 
EXT. RIVENDELL GATE - DAY 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO joins the FELLOWSHIP, ready to depart. They are 
set to go on foot with only SAM’S PONY, BILL, to carry much of 
their baggage. 
 
ANGLE ON: ELROND stands with the ELVES, addressing their only 
hope of success. 
 
     ELROND 
  The Ring-bearer is setting out on  
  the Quest of Mount Doom. On you who  
  travel with him, no oath nor bond is  
  laid to go further that you will.  
  Farewell. Hold to your purpose. May  
  the blessing of Elves and Men and all  
  Free Folk go with you. 
 
     GANDALF 
  The Fellowship awaits the Ring-bearer.  
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO slowly turns to the FELLOWSHIP and timidly makes 
his way to the head of the GROUP.  
 
FRODO’S POV: The faces of those who vowed to follow him watch as 
he makes his way to lead the FELLOWSHIP. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO leads the FELLOWSHIP out of RIVENDELL. He turns 
to GANDALF. 
 
     FRODO 
  Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or  
  right? 
 
ANGLE ON: GANDALF continues looking ahead. 
 
     GANDALF 
  Left. 
 
ANGLE ON: GANDALF places his hand on Frodo’s left shoulder. The 
FELLOWSHIP follows FRODO into the Middle-Earth. 
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns to bid a silent farewell. 
 
ANGLE ON: ARWEN stands in a group of ELVES, watching him.  
 
ANGLE ON: He nods to her and follows the FELLOWSHIP out.

EXT. RIVENDELL VALLEY - MORNING 
 
ANGLE ON: The FELLOWSHIP climbs the long steep path out of the 
cloven vale of RIVENDELL. 
 
      CUT TO: 
 
EXT. ROUGH COUNTRY, SOUTH OF RIVENDELL - DAY 
 
ANGLE ON: The FELLOWSHIP trekking through a land of DEEP VALLEYS 
and turbulent water ... The MISTY MOUNTAINS rise sharply to 
their left. 
 
     GANDALF (V.O.) 
  We must hold to this course, west of  
  the Misty Mountains, for forty days. If  
  our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan will  
  still be open to us. From there, our   
  road turns east, to Mordor. 
 
      CUT TO: 
 
EXT. EREGION HILLS - DAWN 
 
CLOSE ON: SAM at the CAMPFIRE. The SOUND OF CLASHING SWORDS! 
 
WIDER: ARAGORN and BOROMIR are giving PIPPIN SWORD TUITION... 
 
     BOROMIR 
  Get away from the blade, Pippin ... on  
  your toes ... good, very good ... I want 
  you to react, not think. 
 
     SAM 
  Should not be too hard... 
 
     BOROMIR 
  Move your feet. 
 
     MERRY 
  Quite good, Pippin. 
 
     PIPPIN 
  Thanks. 
 
CLOSE ON: GIMLI has managed to corner GANDALF... 
 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
109. 
 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
     GIMLI 
  If anyone were to ask for my opinion, 
  which I note they have not, I would say  
  we are taking the long way round.  
  Gandalf, we can pass through the Mines   
  of Moria. My cousin, Balin, would give  
  us a royal  welcome. 
 
ANGLE ON: GANDALF clearly thinks this is a bad idea. 
 
     GANDALF 
  No, Gimli. I would not take the road 
  through Moria unless I had no other 
  choice. 
 
ANGLE ON: BOROMIR thrusts, catching PIPPIN on the hand. PIPPIN 
throws down his SWORD, KICKS and LUNGES at BOROMIR, tackling him 
o the ground. Much laughter. 
 
ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS’ EYES are fixed on a DISTANT DARK PATCH which 
darts about in the sky, like flying smoke in the wind. 
 
     SAM 
  What is that? 
 
     GIMLI 
  Nothing ... it’s just a wisp of cloud. 
 
     BOROMIR 
   (worried) 
  It's moving fast ... against the wind. 
 
     LEGOLAS 
  Crebain from Dunland!  
      
     ARAGORN 
   (urgently) 
  Hide! 
 
     BOROMIR 
  Merry ... Pippin ... Sam ... take cover! 
 
WIDE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP scramble under what little cover there 
is ... as a regiment of LARGE CROWS fly overhead at GREAT SPEED, 
wheeling and circling above. As their dark shadow passes over 
the FELLOWSHIP a single harsh CROAK is heard...and the CROWS 
suddenly wheel away, back towards the SOUTH.  
 
      (CONTINUED) 
110.

ANGLE ON: GANDALF staggers to his feet. 
 
     GANDALF 
  Spies of Saruman. The passage south is  
  being watched.  
 
GANDALF looks at ARAGORN, turns to the others...gestures towards 
a high mountain pass. 
 
     GANDALF (CONT’D) 
  We must take the Pass of Caradhras! 
 
      CUT TO: 
 
EXT. SNOWY MOUNTAINSIDE - DAY 
 
ANGLE ON: The FELLOWSHIP clamber through ROCK and SNOW.  
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO slips on some SHALE ... as he scrambles to his 
feet, the RING falls on the ground. 
 
CLOSE ON: The RING gleaming in the snow! BOROMIR’S HAND picks it 
up by the CHAIN. 
 
ANGLE ON: He stands, the RING dangling before his eyes. He seems 
to grow in stature, as if absorbing its power.  
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN warily approaches BOROMIR. 
 
ANGLE ON: BOROMIR is motionless ... he stares at the RING, as if 
transfixed. 
 
     ARAGORN 
  Boromir? 
 
     BOROMIR 
  It is a strange fate that we should 
  suffer so much fear and doubt over 
  so small a thing ... such a little 
  thing. 
 
     ARAGORN 
   (quietly) 
  Boromir ... give the Ring to Frodo. 
 
CLOSE ON: ARAGORN’S HAND moves to his sword hilt. 
 
RING’S POV: Looking at BOROMIR’S face. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
111. 
 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
ON THE SOUNDTRACK: The strange HUM VIBRATES. 
 
CLOSE ON: A WEIRD BEATIFIC SMILE lights up on BOROMIR’S face.  
The HUM grows to a deafening roar! BOROMIR suddenly snaps out  
of his trance and hands the RING to FRODO. 
 
     BOROMIR 
   (lightly) 
  As you wish. I care not. 
 
BOROMIR smiles at FRODO, ruffling his hair. 
 
CLOSE ON: ARAGORN unhands his SWORD.

EXT. ISENGARD - DAY 
 
Following the CROWS as they race deeper and deeper, passing a 
vista of INDUSTRY, HUNDREDS OF ORCS and writhing BIRTHSACKS ... 
flying past SARUMAN, who stands upon a wooden GANTRY. 
 
CLOSE ON: SARUMAN, listening to the CRIES of the CROWS. 
 
     SARUMAN 
  So, Gandalf ... you try to lead them   
  over Caradhras. And if that fails ...  
  where then will you go?  
 
INSERT IMAGE: The FELLOWSHIP struggles through the SNOW on 
CARADHRAS.

      CUT TO: 
 
EXT. PASS OF CARADHRAS - DAY 
 
THE FELLOWSHIP are struggling through a blinding blizzard, up 
towards the PASS OF CARADHRAS.

snow ... he suddenly pauses. SARUMAN’S VOICE sweeps by on the 
wind.

THUNDER RUMBLES ... ROCK and SHALE fall from above. 
 
     ARAGORN 
   (urgently) 
  He's trying to bring down the mountain.  
  Gandalf! We must turn back! 
 
     GANDALF 
  No! 
 
GANDALF RAISES HIS STAFF ... HE CHANTS INTO THE WIND. 
 
     GANDALF

CLOUDS ARE FLOWING FROM ALL DIRECTIONS ... converging on the 
distant mountains in a stormy MAELSTROM. 
 
EXT. PASS OF CARADHRAS - DAY 
 
SARUMAN’S voice strengthens ... rolling past the FELLOWSHIP like 
THUNDER. A LIGHTNING CRACK explodes on the mountainside above 
them.  
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO looks up in HORROR as a huge snow avalanche 
thunders down towards them! 
 
ANGLES ON: LEGOLAS pulls GANDALF to safety. ARAGORN shields 
FRODO and SAM as snow piles around them. Within moments, the 
PASS is blocked and the FELLOWSHIP are enveloped in snow. 
BOROMIR and ARAGORN frantically dig for the HOBBITS ... who are 
pulled out SHIVERING and FEARFUL. 
 
     BOROMIR 
   (urgent) 
  We must get off the mountain! Make for  
  the Gap of Rohan and take the West road  
  to my city! 
 
     ARAGORN 
  The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to  
  Isengard. 
 
     GIMLI 
  We cannot pass over a mountain. Let us  
  go under it. Let us go through the  
  Mines of Moria. 
 
ANGLE ON: GANDALF has a concerned look on his face. 
 
     SARUMAN (V.O.) 
  Moria. You fear to go into those mines, 
  don’t you? The Dwarves delved too  
  greedily and too deep. 
 
INT. ORTHANC ANTE-CHAMBER - DAY 
 
ANGLE ON: SARUMAN sits in ORTHANC reviewing an ancient text. 
 
CLOSE ON: The BOOK showing the DOOR to MORIA. 
 
     SARUMAN (CONT’D) 
  You know what they awoke in the darkness 
  of Khazad-dûm. Shadow and flame.

CLOSE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN shivering in BOROMIR’S arms. 
 
     GANDALF (CONT’D) 
  Frodo? 
 
FRODO meets GANDALF’S eye. 
 
     FRODO 
  We will go through the mines. 
 
GANDALF slowly nods.

  So be it.

ruins of a great aqueduct in the mist and ice of the mountains.  
 
ANGLE ON: GANDALF beckons to FRODO. 
 
     GANDALF 
  Frodo, come and help an old man. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO comes forward and allows GANDALF to lean on him. 
  
     GANDALF 
  How is your shoulder? 
 
     FRODO 
  Better than it was. 
 
GANDALF stops.

CONTINUED: 
 
     GANDALF 
  And the Ring? You feel its power growing,  
  don’t you? I’ve felt it too. You must be  
  careful now. Evil will be drawn to you  
  from outside the Fellowship. And, I fear,  
  from within. 
 
ANGLE ON: BOROMIR passes them. They glance at him. 
 
     FRODO 
   (subdued) 
  Who then do I trust? 
 
     GANDALF 
  You must trust yourself. Trust 
  your own strengths. 
 
     FRODO 
  What do you mean? 
 
     GANDALF 
  There are many powers in this  
  world for good or for evil. Some 
  are greater than I am. And  
  against some I have not yet been  
  tested. 
 
CLOSE ON: GIMLI comes to the top of the path and looks in 
WONDER. 
 
     GIMLI 
   (in awe) 
  The Walls of Moria! 
 
WIDE ON: The FELLOWSHIP stands before a looming cliff cut into a 
sheer formation. 
 
EXT. MORIA GATE - NIGHT 
 
Footing is treacherous on the narrow strips of green and greasy 
stones. 
 
ANGLE ON: GIMLI taps the WALL with his axe, listening. GANDALF 
does the same with his staff. 
 
     GIMLI 
  Dwarf doors are invisible when  
  closed.

  Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot 
  find them if their secrets are  
  forgotten. 
 
     LEGOLAS 
  Why doesn’t that surprise me? 
 
CLOSE ON: GIMLI sniffs with disgust at the comment.  
 
ANGLE ON: GANDALF approaches the smooth rock wall between TWO 
TWISTED, GNARLED TREES ... slowly, faint lines appear like 
slender veins of luminous silver running through the stone. 
 
     GANDALF 
  Isildin ... it mirrors only starlight  
  and moonlight. 
 
ANGLE ON: A LARGE MOON rises over the mountains. 
 
ANGLE ON: The lines on the wall grow BROADER and CLEARER, 
forming a glowing arch of interlacing ancient letters and 
symbols. 
 
     GANDALF (CONT’D) 
  It reads, “The door of Durin, Lord of  
  Moria. Speak, friend, and enter.” 
 
     MERRY 
  What do you suppose that means? 
 
     GANDALF 
   (confident) 
  It’s simple. If you are a friend, you  
  speak the password and the doors will  
  open. 
 
GANDALF raises his arms... 
 
   GANDALF (CONT’D) 
  (incanting) 
 Annon Edhellen, edro hi ammen!  
 
 Gate of the Elves, open now for me! 
 
The cliff towers into the night, the wind blows cold, FRODO 
shivers... and the door stands fast. Undaunted, GANDALF raises 
his arms again...

 Fennas Nogothrim, lasto beth lammen.  
 
 Doorway of the Dwarf-folk, listen  
 to the word of my tongue. 
 
   PIPPIN 
 Nothing's happening. 
 
ANGLE ON: GANDALF glances at him, annoyed. He begins to push on 
the doors, but they remain fast. 
 
   GANDALF 
 I once knew every spell in all  
 the tongues of Elves, Men, and  
 Orcs. 
 
   PIPPIN 
 What are you going to do, then? 
 
   GANDALF 
  (angrily) 
 Knock your head against these doors,  
 Peregrin Took! And if that does not  
 shatter them, and I am allowed a little 
 peace from foolish questions, I will 
 try to find the opening words. 
 
    LATER: 
 
GANDALF CONTINUES... 
 
MUMBLING spells in his efforts to open the door. 
 
   GANDALF

  Bye, Bill. 
 
     ARAGORN 
  Go on, Bill, go on ... don't worry,  
  Sam ... he knows his way home. 
 
ARAGORN slaps BILL on the rump ... BILL goes trotting off. 
 
CLOSE ON: SAM watching BILL disappear into the darkness. 
 
SPLASH! MERRY and PIPPIN are tossing stones into the lake. BLACK 
RIPPLING RINGS slowly fan out. PIPPIN is about to throw another 
stone, but ARAGORN grabs his arm. 
 
     ARAGORN 
   (ominous) 
  Do not disturb the water. 
 
ARAGORN watches anxiously as the RIPPLES appear to grow ... he 
exchanges a look with BOROMIR. 
 
ARAGORN’S hand creeps towards his sword.  
 
ANGLE ON: GANDALF gives up in despair ... he sits down beside 
FRODO. 
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO peers at the ELVISH INSCRIPTION ... his face 
breaks into a smile of comprehension. 
 
     FRODO 
   (quietly) 
  It's a riddle... 
 
GANDALF raises his eyebrows... 
 
     FRODO 
  Speak, friend, and enter. What's the  
  Elvish word for friend? 
 
     GANDALF 
  Oh .... mellon.

With that, the rock face silently divides in the middle and TWO 
GREAT DOORS swing outwards ... revealing a blackness deeper than 
night. As the FELLOWSHIP enter the BLACKNESS something in the 
water stirs... 
 
INT. MORIA GATE - NIGHT 
 
The FELLOWSHIP step warily into the darkness of MORIA ... a DANK 
CAVERN, with winding steps leading deeper into the mountain. 
 
     GIMLI 
  Soon, Master Elf, you will enjoy the  
  fabled hospitality of the Dwarves;  
  roaring fires, malt beer, red meat off  
  the bone! This, my friend, is the home  
  of my cousin Balin ... And they call  
  this a mine.  
   (snorting) 
  A mine! 
 
ANGLE ON: A GLOW from GANDALF’S STAFF suddenly lights the 
chamber ... The FELLOWSHIP recoil in HORROR! Many DWARF 
SKELETONS are strewn about, clearly in the dead of some old 
battle ... the rusting armor and shields are peppered with 
arrows and axes 
 
     BOROMIR 
   (grimly) 
  This is no mine ... It's a tomb! 
 
     GIMLI 
   (in horror) 
  Oh ... no ... no ... no...!  
 
LEGOLAS pulls a crude arrow out of a SKELETON. 
 
     LEGOLAS 
  Goblins. 
 
The FELLOWSHIP draw swords and back away, towards the ENTRANCE. 
 
     BOROMIR 
  We make for the Gap of Rohan. We should  
  never have come here.  
 
EXT. MORIA GATE - NIGHT 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO is suddenly PULLED TO THE GROUND! A LONG SINUOUS 
TENTACLE is wrapped around FRODO’S ankle and is dragging him 
towards the lake! 
      (CONTINUED) 
120. 
 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
FRODO CRIES OUT as ARAGORN and BOROMIR rush forward! ARAGORN 
severs the TENTACLE holding FRODO, and pulls him to safety ... 
BOROMIR hacks at the other WRITHING LIMBS, 20 more tentacles 
ripple out of the LAKE! The dark water BOILS as the hideous 
beast lashes out at the FELLOWSHIP!  
 
Again the creature grabs FRODO and pulls him to the lake. FRODO 
is flung in the air as the FELLOWSHIP battle the creature. 
ARAGORN hacks at a tentacle ... FRODO is released, falling into 
BOROMIR’S arms. 
 
     GANDALF 
  Into the mines! 
 
     BOROMIR 
  Legolas! 
 
LEGOLAS shoots an ARROW into the creature’s head, gaining a few 
vital seconds for ARAGORN and BOROMIR as they race out of the 
water with FRODO. The FELLOWSHIP hurriedly back away from the 
CREATURE ... retreating into the MORIA CHAMBER as many COILING 
ARMS seize the large doors. 
 
INT. MORIA GATE - NIGHT 
 
With a shattering echo, the creature rips the doors away, 
creating a rock slide that crashes down the CLIFF FACE. Within 
seconds, tons of rock seal the doorway ... throwing the 
FELLOWSHIP into PITCH BLACKNESS. 
 
ANGLE ON: A faint light rises from GANDALF’S staff, throwing a 
CREEPY GLOW across the old wizard’s face. 
 
     GANDALF 
   (ominous) 
  Now we have but one choice ... we must  
  face the long dark of Moria. Be on your  
  guard ... there are older and fouler  
  things than the Orcs in the deep places 
  of the world.

  Quietly, now. It’s a four day journey to  
  the other side. Let us hope that our  
  presence will go unnoticed.  
 
INT. MORIA MITHRIL MINE - NIGHT 
 
ANGLE ON: The FELLOWSHIP enter a CHAMBER with old ropes and 
ancient ladders.  
 
ANGLE ON: GANDALF touches a shining substance on the wall. 
 
     GANDALF 
  The wealth of Moria was not in gold or  
  jewels but mithril. 
 
GANDALF holds his staff over the expansive drop beside them. The 
FELLOWSHIP looks down.  
 
 
ANGLE ON: The ENDLESS DEPTH of the mine. A FAINT, BLUE GLOW 
issues from its depths. It looks all but abandoned.  
 
The FELLOWSHIP continues onward. 
 
     GANDALF 
  Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings 
  that Thorin gave him. 
 
     GIMLI 
  Oh, that was a kingly gift. 
 
     GANDALF 
  Yes. I never told him, but its worth  
  was greater than the value of the  
  Shire. 
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO’S eyes widen. 
 
      CUT TO: 
 
INT. MORIA CEMETERY CAVERN - NIGHT 
 
They continue up a steep stair, passing through a DWARF 
CEMETERY. The graves are despoiled ... DWARF SKELETONS are 
strewn about and GOBLIN GRAFFITI is scrawled on monuments in 
DRIED DWARF BLOOD. THE ATMOSPHERE is very sinister. 
 
      CUT TO: 
 
122. 
 
 
INT. MORIA TUNNEL FORK - NIGHT 
 
The path splits into three passages ... each disappearing into 
dark tunnel. GANDALF pauses, frowning. 
 
     GANDALF 
  I have no memory of this place.  
 
LATER... 
 
THE FELLOWSHIP are nervously waiting ... while GANDALF sits, 
staring intently at the 3 tunnel mouths in front of him. He 
appears to be in some kind of trance. 
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO turns at the sound of a faint noise down the 
tunnel behind them. 
 
     PIPPIN 
  Are we lost? 
 
     MERRY 
  No. I don’t think we are. Shhh,  
  Gandalf’s thinking. 
 
     PIPPIN 
  Merry! 
 
     MERRY 
  What? 
 
     PIPPIN 
  I'm hungry. 
 
FRODO’S POV: a sudden glimpse of a creature darting in the 
darkness. FRODO is nervous...he approaches GANDALF. 
 
     FRODO 
   (whispers) 
  There's something down there. 
 
     GANDALF 
   (quietly) 
  It's Gollum.  
 
     FRODO 
  Gollum! 
 
     GANDALF 
  He's been following us for three  
  days. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
123. 
 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
TEASING SHOT: An emaciated, leering creature. 
 
     FRODO 
   (disbelieving) 
  He escaped from the dungeons of Barad-dûr? 
 
     GANDALF 
  Escaped ... or was set loose. And now  
  the Ring has drawn him here ... he will  
  never be rid of his need for it. He  
  hates and loves the Ring, as he hates  
  and loves himself. Sméagol’s life is a  
  sad story.  
 
GANDALF catches FRODO’S look of surprise. 
 
     GANDALF (CONT’D) 
  Yes ... Sméagol he was once called ...  
  Before the Ring came to him, before it  
  drove him mad. 
 
GOLLUM’S withered fingers are gripping the cave wall ... his 
LARGE LUMINOUS eyes blinking with malice. 
 
     FRODO 
   (grim) 
  It’s a pity Bilbo didn't kill him when  
  he had the chance. 
 
     GANDALF 
  Pity? It was pity that stayed Bilbo’s  
  hand. Many that live deserve death,  
  and some that die deserve life. Can you 
  give it to  them, Frodo?  
 
FRODO frowns. 
 
     GANDALF (CONT’D) 
  Do not be too eager to deal out death  
  in judgment ... even the very wise  
  cannot see all ends. My heart tells me  
  that Gollum has some part to play yet,  
  for good or ill before this is over.  
  The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of  
  many. 
 
     FRODO 
  I wish the Ring had never come to me   
  ... I wish none of this had happened. 
      (CONTINUED) 
124. 
 
 
CONTINUED: (2) 
 
     GANDALF 
  So do all who live to see such times,  
  but that is not for them to decide. All  
  we have to decide is what to do with  
  the time that is given to us.  
 
There is a note of finality in GANDALF’S voice. 
 
     GANDALF (CONT’D) 
  There are other forces at work in this  
  world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.  
  Bilbo was meant to find the Ring. In  
  which case, you also were meant to have  
  it ... and that is an encouraging  
  thought.  
   (sudden brightness) 
  Ah! It's that way. 
 
GANDALF points at the right hand tunnel ... the FELLOWSHIP 
scramble to their feet. 
 
     MERRY 
   (relieved) 
  He's remembered! 
 
     GANDALF 
  No. But the air doesn’t smell so foul  
  down here. If in doubt, Meriadoc,  
  always follow your nose! 
   (laughs) 
  Yes... 
 
INT. DWARROWDELF CHAMBER, MORIA - DAY 
 
The FELLOWSHIP pass under an arched doorway into a black and 
empty space. GANDALF pauses... 
 
     GANDALF 
  Let me risk a little more light. 
 
GANDALF taps his staff ... for a brief moment a light blazes ... 
like a silent FLASH OF LIGHTNING. GREAT SHADOWS spring up and 
flee... 
 
     GANDALF 
  Behold! The great realm and Dwarf-city  
  of Dwarrowdelf. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
125. 
 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO gasps at the brief sight of a roof, far above 
their heads, upheld by many mighty pillars of stone.  
 
Before them stretches a huge empty hall, with black walls, 
polished and smooth as glass. 
 
     SAM 
  Well, there's an eye opener and no 
  mistake! 
 
Ahead of them, a wooden door has been smashed. BLACK ARROWS are 
embedded in the timbers. TWO GOBLIN SKELETONS lie in the 
doorway. GIMLI rushes ahead... 
 
     GANDALF 
  Gimli!! 
 
      CUT TO: 
 
INT. BALIN’S TOMB, MORIA - DAY 
 
GIMLI rushes into another vast empty chamber ... lit with a 
narrow shaft of sunlight, beaming in from a small hole near the 
roof. DWARF AND GOBLIN SKELETONS are piled high. In the far 
corner sits a stone walled WELL. A SHAFT OF LIGHT falls directly 
onto a stone table in the middle of the room: a single oblong 
block, about 4 feet high, topped with a great slab of white 
stone. GIMLI falls to his knees... 
 
     GIMLI 
  No...no...oh, no! 
 
GIMLI sobs. 
 
GANDALF quietly reads an inscription of runes, carved onto the 
white stone slab. 
 
     GANDALF 
  “Here lies Balin, son of Fundin, Lord of  
  Moria.” He is dead, then. It’s as I feared. 
 
     GIMLI 
 (chanting softly, sobbing) 
 Kilmin malur ni zaram kalil ra  
  narag. Kheled-zâram ... Balin  
  tazlifi. 
 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
126. 
 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
GANDALF carefully lifts the rotting remains of a book from the 
white stone slab. It has been slashed and stabbed ... and 
appears to be covered in DRIED BLOOD. The pages crack and break 
as he opens it. 
 
     LEGOLAS 
   (urgent whisper to Aragorn) 
  We must move on. We cannot linger. 
 
     GANDALF 
   (reading) 
  “They have taken the Bridge and the  
  second hall: we have barred the  
  gates ... but cannot hold them for 
   long ... the ground shakes ... drums  
   drums in the deep ... we cannot get 
   out. A shadow moves in the dark. Will 
  no-one save us? They are coming.” 
 
ANGLE ON: Unnerved, PIPPIN backs away nervously ... He stumbles 
against the well, sending a precariously balanced ARMORED 
SKELETON tumbling in!  
 
MERRY reaches out, GRABBING hold of PIPPIN before he falls. THE 
FELLOWSHIP freeze in stunned silence as the armored skeleton 
clatters down the deep well ... echoing loudly! 
 
ANGLE ON: GANDALF turns angrily on PIPPIN. 
 
     GANDALF 
   (angrily) 
  Fool of a Took! Throw yourself in next  
  time, and rid us of your stupidity! 
 
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN, CHASTENED. 
 
They fall silent. A low rolling BOOM rises from the depths below 
... growing louder ... BOOM ... BOOM ... as if the caverns of 
MORIA were turned into a vast drum. A great horn blasts nearby 
... ANSWERING horns ... running feet ... harsh cries ...  
 
CLOSE ON: SAM’S eyes glance at FRODO’S belt... 
 
     SAM 
   (worried) 
  Mr. Frodo! 
 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
127. 
 
 
CONTINUED: (2) 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO looks down. A cold blue glow is emanating from 
STING’S SCABBARD! FRODO draws the SWORD ... and stares at its 
glowing blade! 
 
     LEGOLAS 
  Orcs! 
 
     ARAGORN 
   (to the Hobbits) 
  Get back! Stay close to Gandalf. 
 
ARAGORN and BOROMIR slam and wedge the doors. BOROMIR catches 
sight of something; he turns to ARAGORN with shock in his eyes. 
 
     BOROMIR 
  They have a cave-troll! 
 
ANGLE ON: GIMLI snatches up two rusty Dwarf axes and leaps onto 
the tomb. 
 
     GIMLI 
   (yelling) 
  Let them come! There is one Dwarf yet in  
  Moria who still draws breath! 
 
BOOM! The door bursts open in a shower of wood fragments, and 20 
GOBLINS charge into the tomb, followed by a HUGH CAVE TROLL! 
 
ANGLES ON: GIMLI ducks a blow and immediately buries his AXES in 
2 GOBLIN HELMETS. ARAGORN and BOROMIR wade into the mass of 
GOBLINS with their swords. LEGOLAS fires deadly arrows into 
GOBLIN throats, desperately trying to SHIELD the HOBBITS! 
GANDALF is clutching his sword, GLAMDRING, and joins in the 
battle! 
 
ANGLES ON: The CAVE TROLL is sweeping his club at ARAGORN ... 
who stumbles backwards ... the huge club descends for the 
killing blow ... SUDDENLY, in a FLASH OF STEEL, BOROMIR’S long 
sword SLICES into the SCALY ARM of the TROLL; it rears back, 
SPEWING GREEN BLOOD! 
 
ANGLES ON: SAM is backed up against a wall .. a sword in one 
hand, a SAUCEPAN in the other. In desperation he swings wildly 
at a GOBLIN with the saucepan! It keels over ... SAM looks 
surprised. He wallops another GOBLIN and it too, drops. 
 
 SAM 
  I think I’m getting the hang of this. 
 
 (CONTINUED) 
128. 
 
 
CONTINUED: (3) 
 
ANGLE ON: The CAVE TROLL lunges forward, thrusting at FRODO’S 
chest with his spear. 
 
 FRODO 
 Aragorn! Aragorn! 
 
SAM screams as FRODO is lifted off his feet by the spear tip and 
slammed against the wall. 
 
 ARAGORN 
 (shocked yell) 
  Frodo! 
 
ANGLES ON: The HOBBITS go crazy. SAM slashes at the CAVE TROLL’S 
knee, bringing him down ... MERRY and PIPPIN jump on him ... 
LEGOLAS fires an arrow ... and the CAVE TROLL topples, dead. 
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN rushes to FRODO’S side as he slumps to the 
floor ... FRODO appears to be dead. 
 
CLOSE ON: GANDALF, ARAGORN, HOBBITS looking horrified... 
 
SUDDENLY, FRODO coughs ... takes a huge breath. 
 
     SAM 
  He's alive. 
 
     FRODO 
  I'm all right. I'm not hurt. 
 
     ARAGORN 
  You should be dead. That spear would  
  have skewered a wild boar. 
 
     GANDALF 
  I think there’s more to this Hobbit  
  than meets the eye. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO opens his shirt to reveal the MITHRIL VEST. The 
TROLL SPEAR did not pierce the MITHRIL. 
 
     GIMLI 
  Mithril! You are full of surprises,  
  Master Baggins. 
 
BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. the sound of the drums rings out again! 
GANDALF turns to the other. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
129.

     GANDALF 
  To the bridge of Khazad-Dûm!

INT. DWARROWDELF CHAMBER, MORIA - DAY 
 
GANDALF leads the FELLOWSHIP into the huge DWARROWDELF CHAMBER. 
 
     GANDALF 
  This way! 
 
They hurry towards a distant door ... as GOBLINS start scuttling 
down the PILLARS behind them, like cockroaches! 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO looks with horror at the overwhelming GOBLIN 
army that’s rushing towards them! 
 
SUDDENLY! A deafening roar fills the air! A fiery light dances 
down the hallway ... the pillars castings eerie shadows. 
 
ANGLES ON: The GOBLINS freeze. They back fearfully away from the 
approaching beast ... melting into the darkness. 
 
     BOROMIR 
  What is this new devilry? 
 
A HUGE SHADOW, surrounded by FLAME, falls across the hall ... 
the ground shakes ... an unearthly sound rumbles. 
 
     GANDALF 
   (quietly) 
  A Balrog ... a demon of the ancient world!  
  This foe is beyond any of you!  
   (urgent yell) 
  Run! Quickly! 
 
      CUT TO: 
 
INT. STAIRWAY OF KHAZAD-DÛM, MORIA - DAY 
 
The BALROG, a massive creature rises from a chasm, a great 40- 
FOOT MAN-BEAST, with a MANE OF FLAMES! In one hand is a BLADE 
... like a stabbing TONGUE OF FIRE; in the other, a WHIP of MANY 
THONGS. 
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN leads the FELLOWSHIP to the top of a dizzying 
stairway ... GANDALF follows, leaning heavily on his staff. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
130. 
 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
CLOSE ON: ARAGORN looks at GANDALF, concerned. 
 
     GANDALF 
  Lead them on, Aragorn! The bridge is  
  near.  
 
ARAGORN hesitates ... GANDALF looks at him. 
 
     GANDALF (CONT’D) 
  Do as I say; Swords are no more use 
  here. 
 
The FELLOWSHIP race down the stairway.  
 
ARAGORN picks up FRODO ... leaping across a gaping chasm ... 
GANDALF yells to the others.  
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN makes to throw GIMLI across the chasm. 
 
     GIMLI 
  Nobody tosses a dwarf! 
 
The BALROG smashes through the wall and spreads its VAST WINGS. 
It swoops down past the FELLOWSHIP, disappearing into a FLAMING 
PIT! 
 
      CUT TO: 
 
INT. BRIDGE OF KHAZAD-DÛM, MORIA - DAY 
 
The FELLOWSHIP run into the SECOND HALL ... the floor is split 
with fissures that spit flame. 
 
     GANDALF 
   (yelling) 
  Over the bridge! Fly! 
 
They race towards the slender bridge of stone ... without kerb 
or rail ... at the far end of the hall. The FELLOWSHIP 
recklessly hurry over the dizzying bridge .. but GANDALF ... the 
last ... pauses in the middle of the span ... he faces the 
BALROG ... staff in one hand ... GLAMDRING in the other! 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO looks back in horror: 
 
     GANDALF (CONT’D) 
  You cannot pass! 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
131. 
 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
     FRODO 
   (alarmed yell) 
  Gandalf! 
 
     GANDALF 
   (yelling) 
  I am a servant of the Secret Fire,  
  wielder of the flame of Anor. The dark  
  fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn. 
 
FRODO watches as the BALROG puts one foot on the bridge and 
draws up to FULL HEIGHT, wings spreading from wall-to-wall. 
GANDALF is a tiny figure, balanced precariously on the narrow 
bridge. 
 
     GANDALF (CONT’D) 
  Go back to the Shadow!  
 
The BALROG slashes at GANDALF with its SWORD OF FLAME ... 
GANDALF blocks with GLAMDRING ... a ringing clash and the 
BALROG’S SWORD SHATTERS into MOLTEN FRAGMENTS! 
 
     GANDALF 
   (booming) 
  You shall not pass!! 
 
The BALROG places one foot onto the bridge. 
 
     ARAGORN 
  He cannot stand alone! Elendil! I  
  am with you Gandalf! 
 
     BOROMIR 
   (raising his sword) 
  Gondor! 
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN and BOROMIR race forward, swords drawn. 
 
GANDALF CRIES ALOUD as he summons his LAST RESERVES OF 
STRENGTH!! 
 
He thumps the bridge with his staff ... a blinding sheet of 
white flame springs up ... the staff shatters ... the bridge 
breaks ... right at the BALROG’S feet.  
 
The stone bridge drops away into the GULF ... from under the 
BALROG. For a moment, the great BEAST  remains poised in the air 
... then it plunges down: 
 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
132. 
 
 
CONTINUED: (2) 
 
SLOW MOTION: RELIEF floods FRODO’S face ... GANDALF remains 
trembling on the lip of the broken bridge. 
 
SLOW MOTION: As the BALROG falls, he lashes out with his whip of 
fire... 
 
SLOW MOTION: The thongs of the whip lash and curl around 
GANDALF’S knees, dragging him over the brink! GANDALF just 
manages to hang on by his fingertips. 
 
     FRODO 
   (screaming) 
  Gandalf! 
 
     GANDALF 
   (fierce) 
  Fly, you fools! 
 
CLOSE ON: GANDALF lets go his grip and falls away ... following 
the BALROG into the BOTTOMLESS ABYSS! 
 
FRODO cries out! BOROMIR scoops him up and carries him away! 
 
     FRODO 
  No! 
 
     ARAGORN 
  Gandalf! 
 
They rush towards an archway. 
 
      CUT TO: 
 
EXT. DIMRILL DALE DOOR - DAY 
 
The FELLOWSHIP tumble out of the GREAT EASTERN GATE on to a 
grassy sunlit hillside. SAM, MERRY, and PIPPIN fall slowly to 
the ground, SOBBING ...  
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns to LEGOLAS and GIMLI. 
 
     ARAGORN 
   (urgent) 
  Legolas, get them up. 
 
     BOROMIR 
  Give them a moment ... for pity's sake! 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
133.

     ARAGORN 
  By nightfall these hills will be  
  swarming with Orcs! We must reach the  
  woods of Lothlórien. Come Boromir,  
  Legolas, Gimli, get them up. On your  
  feet, Sam.  
 
ANGLE ON: BOROMIR glances towards FRODO, then back at ARAGORN.  
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO is walking away, as if in a daze. 
 
     ARAGORN (CONT’D) 
  Frodo? Frodo! 
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO SLOWLY TURNS ... a look of numb shock on his 
devastated face. The FELLOWSHIP marches on. 
 
      CUT TO: 
 
EXT. DIMRILL DALE HILLSIDE - DUSK 
 
ARAGORN scours ahead of the COMPANY, as they stumble on in the 
fading light ... in the distance the shimmer of a large forest 
can be seen ... LOTHLÓRIEN! 
 
EXT. EDGE OF LOTHLÓRIEN - DUSK 
 
WIDE ON: The FELLOWSHIP run across a forest floor strewn with 
YELLOW FLOWERS ... above is a ROOF OF GOLDEN LEAVES, held up by 
SILVER PILLARS ... the TRUNKS of HUGE, GREY TREES.  
 
ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS, taking in the surroundings as if a return 
home. 
 
     LEGOLAS 
   (musing) 
  Ah, Lothlórien. The fairest of all the  
  dwellings of my people. There are no  
  trees like the trees of this land, for  
  in autumn the leaves fall not, but turn  
  to gold. Not till the spring comes and  
  the new green opens do they fall, and  
  then the boughs are laden with yellow  
  flowers; and the floor of the wood is  
  golden, and golden is the roof, and its  
  pillars are of silver, for the bark of  
  the trees is smooth and grey. So still  
  our songs in Mirkwood say. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
134.

ANGLE ON: In contrast, GIMLI looks nervously around... 
 
     GIMLI 
  Stay close, young Hobbits ... they say 
  a great sorceress lives in these woods.  
  An Elf-witch of terrible power. All who  
  look upon her fall under her spell... 
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO hesitates ... a STRANGE VOICE whispers in his 
head... 
 
     GALADRIEL (V.O.) 
  Frodo... 
 
     GIMLI 
  And are never seen again! 
 
     GALADRIEL (V.O.) 
  ...your coming to us is as the  
  footsteps of doom. You bring great evil  
  here, Ring-bearer. 
 
     SAM 
  Mr. Frodo? 
 
     GIMLI 
  Well, here’s one Dwarf she won't  
  ensnare so easily. I have the eyes of a  
  hawk and the ears of a fox! 
 
The FELLOWSHIP are suddenly surrounded by ARMED ELVES. DEADLY 
ARROWS are aimed at their heads. HALDIR, the ELVISH CAPTAIN, 
steps forward... 
 
     HALDIR 
  The Dwarf breathes so loud we could  
  have shot him in the dark. 
 
      CUT TO: 
 
INT. CERIN AMROTH, LOTHLÓRIEN - NIGHT 
 
Night is deepening amongst the windy trees. The FELLOWSHIP

 Welcome Legolas, son of Thranduil. 
 
   LEGOLAS 
  (Elvish; with subtitles) 
 Govannas vîn gwennen le, Haldir o Lórien.  
 
 Our Fellowship stands in your debt,  
 Haldir of Lórien. 
 
ANGLE ON: HALDIR glances at ARAGORN. 
 
   HALDIR 
  (Elvish; with subtitles) 
 A, Aragorn in Dúnedain istannen le

 Oh, Aragorn of the Dúnedain, you  
 are known to us. 
 
   ARAGORN 
 Haldir. 
 
   GIMLI 
 So much for the legendary courtesy  
 of the Elves! Speak words we can  
 also understand! 
 
   HALDIR 
 We have not had dealings with the  
 Dwarves since the Dark Days. 
 
   GIMLI 
 And you know what this Dwarf says  
 to that? Ishkhaqwi ai durugnul! 
 
 I spit on your grave! 
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN takes GIMLI by the arm. 
 
   ARAGORN 
  (stern) 
 That was not so courteous. 
 
HALDIR moves on to FRODO. 
 
    (CONTINUED) 
136. 
 
 
CONTINUED: (2) 
 
   HALDIR 
 You bring great evil with you. 
  (to ARAGORN) 
 You can go no further. 
 
HALDIR walks away.  
 
ANGLE ON: SAM and PIPPIN turn to look at FRODO. FRODO appears 
uncomfortable. 
 
LATER... 
 
The FELLOWSHIP sit while ARAGORN speaks with HALDIR. 
 
   ARAGORN 
 Boe ammen veriad lîn. Andelu i ven!  
 
 We need your protection. The road  
 is fell! 
 
HALDIR whispers back inaudibly. 
 
   ARAGORN 
 Merin le telim.  
 
 I wish we may come with you. 
 
HALDIR answers quietly, again so that only ARAGORN can hear his  
words. 
 
   ARAGORN 
 Henio, aníron boe ammen i dulu  
 lîn!  
 
 Please, understand, we need  
 your support! 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO looks to the remainder of the FELLOWSHIP. As 
they meet his eyes, they look away, as if he has become a 
scourge to them. 
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN continues to argue loudly with HALDIR.  
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO, looking at his friends, sees blame that does 
not truly exist anywhere but in his mind. He is alone, it seems.  
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN pleads with HALDIR. 
 
    (CONTINUED) 
137.

   ARAGORN 
 Andelu i ven.  
 
 The road is very dangerous. 
 
ANGLE ON: BOROMIR approaches FRODO. 
 
   BOROMIR 
 Gandalf's death was not in vain. 
 nor would he have you give up hope.  
 You carry a heavy burden, Frodo. 
 Don't carry the weight of the dead. 
 
HALDIR stands before FRODO. 
 
   HALDIR 
 Very well. Here we will stay awhile,  
 and come to the city of Galadhrim on  
 the morrow. 
 
INT. CERIN AMROTH, LOTHLÓRIEN - DAY 
 
ANGLE ON: SAM and FRODO sit on one of the many platforms in the 
trees at CERIN AMROTH. SAM suddenly looks up and around, with a 
puzzled expression. He rubs his eyes. 
 
   FRODO 
 What is it? 
 
   SAM 
 It’s an odd thing, Mr. Frodo. It’s 
 sunlight and bright day, right enough. 
 I thought that Elves were all for moon 
 and stars. But this is more Elvish than 
 anything I ever heard tell of. I feel 
 as if I was inside a song, if you take 
 my meaning. 
 
   HALDIR 
  (from behind them) 
 You feel the power of the Lady of 
 Galadhrim. Would it please you to

WIDE ON: FRODO and SAM follow HALDIR up a long series of 
platforms until they reach the pinnacle of the trees.

ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM approach the edge of a high platform and 
look out in wonder.  
 
HIGH WIDE SHOT: MIDDLE EARTH stretches out for miles and miles 
to the NORTH. Far to the NORTH, a shadow lingers over the FOREST 
OF MIRKWOOD. 
 
ANGLE ON: HALDIR points the HOBBITS’ gaze to the dark cloud. 
 
   HALDIR 
 There lies the fastness of Southern 
 Mirkwood. It is clad in a forest of 
 dark fir, where the trees strive one  
 against another and their branches rot 
 and whither. In the midst upon a stony 
 height stands Dol Guldur, where long 
 the hidden Enemy had his dwelling. We 
 fear that now it is inhabited again, 
 and with power sevenfold. A black cloud 
 lies often over it of late.  
 
PAN ON WIDE SHOT: From ORTHANC to the WEST across the 
magnificent view to MORDOR and BARAD-DÛR in the EAST. 
 
   HALDIR (CONT’D) 
 In this high place you may see the two 
 powers that are oppose one to another; 
 and ever they strive now in thought, 
 but whereas the light perceives the 
 very heart of the darkness, its own 
 secret has not been discovered. Not 
 yet. 
 
ANGLE ON: HALDIR leaves the high place. With a final look, FRODO 
and SAM follow. 
 
INT. CERIN AMROTH, LOTHLÓRIEN - DAY 
 
CLOSE ON: A SMALL GOLDEN FLOWER in someone’s hand. 
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN, admiring the beauty of this flower. 
 
   ARAGORN 
 Arwen vanimelda, namárië.

FRODO and smiles.

   ARAGORN 
 Here is the heart of Elvendom on earth,  
 and here my heart dwells ever, unless 
 there be a light beyond the dark roads 
 that we still must tread, you and I. 
 
   FRODO 
 Do you believe we may yet succeed 
 in our quest? 
 
   ARAGORN 
 We shall endure to the last.  
 
    CUT TO: 
 
EXT. LOTHLÓRIEN HILLTOP - DAY 
 
HALDIR leads the FELLOWSHIP onto a HILL TOP. They look with 
wonderment at the vista spread before them. 
 
WIDE ON: Several miles towards the SOUTH, a LARGE HILL rises out 
of the woods. Upon the hill rise many mighty MALLORN TREES, 
taller than any others ... NESTLED high in the crown of the 
mallorns is a BEAUTIFUL CITY. It GLEAMS in the low rays of the 
late afternoon ... green, gold, and silver. To the east of CARAS 
GALADHON, the WOODS of LÓRIEN run down the pale gleam of ANDUIN, 
the great river.  
 
Beyond the RIVER, the land appears flat and empty, formless and 
vague, until far away, it rises again like a dark dreary wall. 
The SUN that lies on LOTHLÓRIEN has not power to enlighten the 
shadows that lie beyond. 
 
   HALDIR 
 Caras Galadon. The heart of Elvendom on 
 earth. This is the city of Galadhrim 
 where dwell the Lord Celeborn and of 
 Galadriel, Lady of Light. 
 
    CUT TO: 
 
EXT. CELEBORN’S CHAMBER, CARAS GALADHON - NIGHT 
 
ANGLE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP step onto a wide fleet filled with a 
soft light. The walls are green and silver, the roof gold and in 
its midst is the trunk of the mighty MALLORN TREE, now tapering 
toward its crown. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
140. 
 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
ANGLE ON: CELEBORN steps forward to greet the guests. His hair 
is long and silver, his face grave and beautiful, with no sign 
of age upon it. Next to him stands GALADRIEL, the LADY OF THE 
ELVES. She has hair of deep gold and timeless unsurpassed 
beauty. 
 
ANGLE ON: CELEBORN looks hard at ARAGORN... 
 
     CELEBORN 
  The enemy knows you have entered here.  
  What hope you had in secrecy is now  
  gone. Eight there are here, yet nine  
  there were set out from Rivendell.  
  Tell me, where is Gandalf? For I much  
  desire to speak with him. I can no  
  longer see him from afar. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO looks at GALADRIEL, standing silently beside 
CELEBORN. 
 
     GALADRIEL 
   (softly aloud) 
  Gandalf the Grey did not pass the  
  borders of this land. He has fallen  
  into Shadow.  
 
     LEGOLAS 
  He was taken by both Shadow and flame.  
  A Balrog of Morgoth. For we went  
  needlessly into the net of Moria. 
 
ANGLE ON: The FELLOWSHIP bow their heads in sadness at the 
memory of GANDALF. 
 
ANGLE ON: CELEBORN appears surprised. 
 
     GALADRIEL 
  Needless were none of the deeds of  
  Gandalf in life. We do not yet know his  
  full purpose.  
 
GALADRIEL surveys the face of the FELLOWSHIP. 
 
CLOSE ON: GIMLI looks up as GALADRIEL addresses him.

CONTINUED: (2) 
 
     GALADRIEL 
  Do not let the great emptiness of  
  Khazad-dûm fill your heart Gimli, son  
  of Glóin. For the world has grown full  
  of peril, and in all lands, love is now  
  mingled with grief. 
 
ANGLE ON: GALADRIEL looks over he FELLOWSHIP again to meet her 
gaze with BOROMIR’S. 
 
CLOSE ON: BOROMIR is suddenly fearful and nervous. 
 
CLOSE ON: GALADRIEL’S eyes piercing BOROMIR. 
 
ANGLE ON: BOROMIR turns away from her. 
 
ANGLE ON: GALADRIEL’S gaze remains on him for a moment before 
turning to CELEBORN. 
 
     CELEBORN 
  What now becomes of this Fellowship?  
  Without Gandalf, hope is lost. 
 
ANGLE ON: GALADRIEL looks to ARAGORN. 
 
     GALADRIEL 
  The quest stands upon the edge of a  
  knife. Stray but a little and it will  
  fail, to the ruin of all... Yet hope  
  remains while the company is true.  
 
GALADRIEL’S eyes settle on SAM. 
 
     GALADRIEL 
  Do not let your hearts be troubled. Go  
  now and rest, for you are weary with  
  sorrow and much toil.  
 
GALADRIEL’S eyes turn to FRODO ... her voice fades. 
 
     GALADRIEL 
  Tonight you will sleep in peace. 
   (whispered v/o) 
  Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...

EXT. CARAS GALADON, LOTHLÓRIEN - NIGHT 
 
GIMLI, LEGOLAS, MERRY, PIPPIN, FRODO, and SAM are in a pavilion 
set among the trees near the fountain. They lie on soft couches 
as ELVES leave food and wine for them. MOURNFUL SINGING drifts 
down from the trees above. 
 
     LEGOLAS 
   (sadly) 
  A lament for Gandalf... 
 
     MERRY 
  What do they say about him? 
 
     LEGOLAS 
  I have not the heart to tell you. For me,  
  the grief is still too near. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO lies on his bed watching the others. SAM works 
with PIPPIN. 
 
     SAM 
  I bet they don’t mention his  
  fireworks. There should be a verse  
  about them. 
 
ANGLE ON: SAM stands up to add his own verse to the ELVEN SONG. 
 
     SAM 
  The finest rockets ever seen 
  They burst in stars of blue and green 
  Or after thunder, silver showers 
  Come falling like a rain of flowers. 
  Oh, that doesn’t do them justice  
  by a long road. 
 
SAM sits down, frustrated and disappointed with himself.

ANGLE ON: BOROMIR is sitting alone ... ARAGORN approaches him. 
 
 
     ARAGORN 
  Take some rest. These borders are well 
  protected. 
 
ANGLE ON: Moonlight catches the trace of tears on BOROMIR’S 
face. ARAGORN kneels beside him. 
 
     BOROMIR 
  I will find no rest here. I heard her  
  voice inside my head. She spoke of my  
  father and the fall of Gondor. She said  
  to me, “Even now, there is hope left.”  
  But I cannot see it ... it is long since  
  we had any  hope.  
 
CLOSE ON: BOROMIR looks at ARAGORN in despair. 
 
     BOROMIR (CONT’D) 
  My father is a noble man, but his rule  
  is failing, and our ... our people lose  
  faith. He looks to me to make things  
  right ... and I would do it, I would  
  see the glory of Gondor restored. Have  
  you ever seen it, Aragorn? The White  
  Tower of Ecthelion, glimmering like a  
  spike of pearl and silver, its banners  
  caught high in the morning breeze ...  
  have you ever been called home by the  
  clear ringing of silver trumpets? 
 
     ARAGORN 
  I have seen the White City ... long  
  ago. 
 
BOROMIR feels ARAGORN’S love for MINAS TIRITH and takes heart. 
 
     BOROMIR 
  One day, our paths will lead us there,  
  and the tower guard will take up the  
  call “the Lords of Gondor have   
  returned.” 
 
ARAGORN returns BOROMIR’S smile ... betraying his disquiet 
sadness only when BOROMIR looks away. 
 
144. 
 
 
LATER... 
 
The FELLOWSHIP are asleep on their beds. GIMLI is snoring 
loudly. 
 
CLOSE ON: BARE FEET treads soundlessly across the lawn. 
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO’S EYES FLICKER OPEN ... as if by instinct. 
 
ANGLE ON: GALADRIEL, her WHITE dress glowing in the moonlight, 
glances at him. FRODO follows her ... as if drawn by an 
invisible force. 
 
EXT. GALADRIEL’S GLADE, LOTHLÓRIEN - NIGHT 
 
Upon a low stone pedestal, carved like a branching tree, sits a 
shallow SILVER BASIN. GALADRIEL leads FRODO into the small 
GLADE. 
 
     GALADRIEL 
  Will you look into the mirror? 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO looks with apprehension at the silver basin. 
 
     FRODO 
   (warily) 
  What will I see? 
 
GALADRIEL pours water into the basin from a silver jug ... a 
GLOW rises from the water. 
 
     GALADRIEL 
  Even the wisest cannot tell. For the  
  mirror shows many things ... things  
  that were ... things that are ... and  
  some things that have not yet come to  
  pass. 
 
FRODO slowly steps up to the PEDESTAL ... he peers into the 
glossy surface. The night sky is reflected in the water ... 
suddenly a figure takes form ... the bowed figure of an OLD MAN, 
CLAD IN WHITE ROBES. He walks down a long road. FRODO leans 
closer to the mirror’s surface. 
 
CLOSE ON: GANDALF LIFTS HIS HEAD AND LOOKS DIRECTLY AT FRODO! 
 
FRODO gasps, his face lighting up with hope. 
 
     FRODO 
   (joyous) 
  Gandalf! 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
145. 
 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
GANDALF looks at FRODO with a fierce intensity. FRODO reaches 
out his hand toward the surface of the mirror. Suddenly the 
image flares, burning out to white. 
 
THE VISION SHIFTS ... FRODO gasps in horror! The SHIRE is in 
ruins!  
 
THE IMAGE SUDDENLY WIDENS TO FILL THE SCREEN ... buildings 
burning ... bodies strewn about ... DARK SHAPES of ORCS looting 
and destroying ... BAG END, billowing in flames! The Party Tree 
is hacked down.  
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO reels back as the mirror seems to grow. The 
nightmarish image sweeps past his head, engulfing him entirely.  
 
IMAGE: HOBBITON ... now an INDUSTRIAL WASTELAND. The fields and 
trees destroyed ... replaced with BRICK FACTORIES belching 
smoke!  
 
IMAGE: ORCS brutally herd manacled HOBBITS into the FACTORIES! 
We see SAM ... MERRY ... and ROSIE COTTON. SOOT-STAINED and 
SOBBING, they disappear into the factory hellhole! 
 
SUDDENLY, the mirror goes dark ... and out of the black abyss a 
SINGLE EYE GROWS. 
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO IS FROZEN. Unable to move or cry out. The RING 
dangles from his neck, inches above the water ... not shimmering 
with curls of steam. FIRE erupts around the EYE.  
 
WITH A YELL, FRODO pushes himself away from the pedestal and 
collapses on the ground. Light instantly fades from the mirror. 
FRODO comes to his senses ... he is shocked.  
 
ANGLE ON: GALADRIEL stands still as a statue, unmoved, untouched 
by the horror. 
 
     GALADRIEL 
  I know what it is you saw ... for it is  
  also in my mind. It is the future,   
  Frodo. It is what will come to pass if  
  you should fail.  
 
GALADRIEL looks at FRODO intensely ... FRODO looks down ... in 
his hand he is clutching the RING. FRODO looks up at GALADRIEL. 
 
 
      (CONTINUED)

     GALADRIEL (CONT’D) 
  The Fellowship is breaking. It is  
  already begun. He will try to take the  
  Ring. You know of whom I speak. One by  
  one, it will destroy them all. 
 
     FRODO (V.O.) 
  If you ask it of me, I will give you  
  the One Ring. 
 
     GALADRIEL 
  You offer it to me freely ... I do not  
  deny that my heart has greatly desired  
  this. 
 
GALADRIEL suddenly seems to rise in stature before FRODO’S eyes. 
FRODO is suddenly afraid of her. 
 
     GALADRIEL 
  In place of the Dark Lord, you would  
  have a Queen, not dark, but beautiful  
  and terrible as the Dawn. Treacherous  
  as the Sea! Stronger than the  
  foundations of the earth ... All shall  
  love me and despair! 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO takes a step away from GALADRIEL...  
 
ANGLE ON: GALADRIEL suddenly laughs ... a slender ELF-WOMAN once 
more, clad in simple white, her voice soft and sad.  
 
     GALADRIEL (CONT’D) 
   (gently) 
  I pass the test.  
   (laughs) 
  I will diminish, and go into the West,  
  and remain  Galadriel. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO’S confidence drains away. 
 
     FRODO 
  I cannot do this alone. 
 
     GALADRIEL 
  You are a Ring-bearer, Frodo. To bear a  
  Ring of Power is to be alone.

CLOSE ON: GALADRIEL raises her hand to show FRODO her own RING. 
 
     GALADRIEL (CONT’D) 
  This is Nenya, the Ring of Adamant. And 
  I am its keeper. 
 
GALADRIEL lowers her hand, hiding NENYA once more. 
 
     GALADRIEL (CONT’D) 
  This task was appointed to you. And 
  if you do not find a way, no one will. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO realizes what her message is. 
 
     FRODO 
  Then I know what I must do. It's   
  just I’m afraid to do it. 
 
GALADRIEL kneels down to FRODO’S height, staring at him 
intently. 
 
     GALADRIEL 
  Even the smallest person can change 
  the course of the future. 
 
CLOSE ON: THE RING lies in the palm of FRODO’S hand ... his 
fingers close over it.

  Do you know how Orcs first came into  
  being? They were Elves once. Taken by  
  the Dark Powers ... tortured and  
  mutilated ... a ruined and terrible

HAI are smearing themselves in white paint ... a creepy 
ritualistic ceremony ... the WHITE HAND OF ISENGARD is smeared 
on bodies, faces, and armor. 
 
ANGLE ON: SARUMAN addresses a crowd of 200 fully-armed URUK-HAI. 
 
     SARUMAN 
  Hunt them down. Do not stop until they  
  are found. You do not know pain. You do  
  not know fear. You will taste man-flesh. 
 
SARUMAN turns to LURTZ. 
 
     SARUMAN (CONT’D)

  One of the Halflings carries something  
  of great value ... bring them to me ... 
  alive and unspoiled ... kill the

LURTZ is leading 200 URUK-HAI out of ISENGARD ... they run fast,

Elven boat. MERRY and PIPPIN look up as he pulls a small piece 
of bread from one of the packs. 
 
     LEGOLAS 
  Lembas. Elvish waybread. 
 
He takes a bite. 
 
     LEGOLAS 
  One small bite is enough to fill  
  the stomach of a grown Man. 
 
He stuffs the remaining piece back in the pack and places it in 
the boats.

another boat and quickly reveals he has no measure of sea legs.  
 
     CELEBORN (V.O.)

  Seldom do Orcs journey in the open  
  under the sun, yet these have done so.

GALADRIEL leans over and kisses his head. 
 
END FLASHBACK 
 
As the FELLOWSHIP’S boats drift past, GALADRIEL stands alone, 
watching from the banks of the river. In his head, FRODO still 
hears her voice... 
 
     GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT’D) 
  May it be a light for you in dark  
  places, when all other lights go out. 
 
CLOSE ON: GIMLI riding at the head of his boat, paddled by 
LEGOLAS. 
 
     GIMLI 
  I have taken my worst wound at this 
  parting having looked my last upon 
  that which is fairest. Henceforth I 
  will call nothing fair unless it be 
  her gift to me. 
 
     LEGOLAS 
  What was her gift? 
 
     GIMLI 
  I asked her for one hair from her 
  golden head. She gave me three. 
 
CLOSE ON: LEGOLAS smiles. 
 
EXT. RIVER ANDUIN - DAY 
 
The boats pass into the GREAT RIVER ANDUIN. The THREE ELVEN 
boats carry the FELLOWSHIP steadily southward. GREEN TREES 
slowly give way to a brown and withered land. 
 
EXT. FOREST - DAY 
 
The URUK forces are running through the trees with deadly 
purpose. 
 
EXT. RIVER ANDUIN - DAY 
 
A flock of birds circle high above, BLACK against the PALE SKY. 
ARAGORN watches them with concern. 
 
155. 
 
 
EXT. RIVER ANDUIN BANKS - NIGHT 
 
The THREE BOATS are safely stored on the bank out of the water.  
 
ANGLE ON: BOROMIR hides behind a rock watching the river.  
 
CLOSE ON: A LOG floats down the river. A HAND grasps the log and 
pulls itself onto it. Who or whatever it is seems to be trying 
to remain concealed from the eyes of the FELLOWSHIP. 
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN approaches from behind BOROMIR. 
 
     ARAGORN 
  Gollum. He has tracked us since  
  Moria. 
 
GOLLUM’S POV: GOLLUM watches the BOROMIR and ARAGORN stand 
behind the ROCK.  
 
ANGLE ON: The log runs into a rock on the opposite side of the 
river and stops. 
 
     ARAGORN (O.S.) 
  I had hoped we would lose him on  
  the river. 
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN and BOROMIR continue watching GOLLUM. 
 
     ARAGORN (CONT’D) 
  But he’s too clever a waterman. 
 
     BOROMIR 
  And if he alerts the enemy to our  
  whereabouts, it will make the  
  crossing even more dangerous. 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO listens to the exchange between ARAGORN and 
BOROMIR. He looks worried. 
 
     SAM (O.S.) 
  Have some food, Mr. Frodo. 
 
     FRODO 
  No, Sam. 
 
     SAM 
  You haven’t eaten anything all day.  
  You’re not sleeping, neither. Don’t  
  think I haven’t noticed. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
156. 
 
 
ANGLE ON: SAM moves from the campfire to sit with FRODO. 
 
     SAM 
  Mr. Frodo- 
 
     FRODO 
  I’m all right. 
 
     SAM 
  But you’re not. I’m here to help you.  
  I promised Gandalf that I would. 
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO looks at SAM, sadly, with the full weight of the 
knowledge of what he must do. 
 
     FRODO 
  You can’t help me, Sam. Not this time.  
  Get some sleep. 
 
FRODO turns away from SAM and returns to his own thoughts. 
Reluctantly, SAM concedes and leaves FRODO alone. 
 
ANGLE ON: BOROMIR turns away from the rock to ARAGORN. 
 
     BOROMIR 
  Minas Tirith is the safer road. You  
  know that. From there we can regroup.  
  Strike out for Mordor from a place  
  of strength. 
 
     ARAGORN 
  There is no strength in Gondor that  
  can avail us. 
 
     BOROMIR 
  You were quick enough to trust the  
  Elves. 
 
ARAGORN doesn’t respond, but listens impatiently. 
 
     BOROMIR (CONT’D) 
   (desperately) 
  Have you so little faith in your own  
  people? Yes, there is weakness. There  
  is frailty. But there is courage also,  
  and honor to be found in Men. But you  
  will not see that.  
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns away from BOROMIR. BOROMIR grabs 
ARAGORN’S tunic, and turns ARAGORN to him. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
157. 
 
 
CONTINUED: (2) 
 
     BOROMIR (CONT’D) 
  You are afraid! 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO listens intently to BOROMIR arguing with 
ARAGORN. 
 
     BOROMIR (O.S.) (CONT’D) 
  All your life, you have hidden in  
  the shadows. 
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN calmly listens to BOROMIR’S ravings.  
 
     BOROMIR (CONT’D) 
  Scared of who you are, of what  
  you are.  
 
ARAGORN adjusts his tunic and turns away from BOROMIR. BOROMIR 
is speechless. ARAGORN turns back to him. 
 
     ARAGORN 
  I will not lead the Ring within a  
  hundred leagues of your city. 
 
      CUT TO: 
 
EXT. RIVER ANDUIN - DAY 
 
ANGLE ON: BOROMIR, still feeling the defeat from the previous 
evening, paddles down the river along with the rest of the 
FELLOWSHIP. He glances scathingly towards ARAGORN.  
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN refuses to return his glance. 
 
EXT. PILLARS OF THE KINGS, RIVER ANDUIN - DAY 
 
The THREE ELVEN boats drift slowly through the steep rocky gorge 
in the PRE-DAWN light.  
 
CLOSE ON: ARAGORN, slowly paddling in the stern. 
 
     ARAGORN 
   (quietly) 
  Frodo.  
 
FRODO slowly looks up, his eyes widening with amazement.  
 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
158. 
 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
WIDE ON: TWO ENORMOUS ROCK STATUES, towering like 300 foot 
pinnacles on either side of the river ... carved images of 
GONDORIAN KINGS of old. They loom over the boats with power and 
majesty. 
 
     ARAGORN (CONT’D) 
  The Argonath... 
 
CLOSE ON: ARAGORN ... strangely moved by the beauty of the 
silent sentinels. He speaks, almost as if to himself. 
 
     ARAGORN (CONT’D) 
  Long have I desired to look upon the  
  kings of old ... my kin. 
 
The FELLOWSHIP stare in stunned silence as the current takes 
them through the narrow gap at the STATUES’ feet. 
 
WIDE ON: CRANING UP past the statues vast crumbling heads, to 
REVEAL a LARGE LAKE only a mile down river... 
 
EXT. SHORE OF NEN HITHOEL - DAY 
 
ANGLE ON: THE FELLOWSHIP as they leap out of the boats and 
clamber onto the wooded shore. 
 
     ARAGORN 
  We cross the lake at nightfall, hide  
  the boats and continue on foot ... we  
  approach Mordor from the North. 
 
     GIMLI 
   (gloomy) 
  Oh, yes, just a simple matter of  
  finding our way through Emyn Muil, an  
  impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp  
  rocks. And after that, it gets even  
  better ... a festering, stinking  
  marshland as far as the eye can see. 
 
     ARAGORN 
  That is our road. I suggest you take  
  some rest and recover your strength,  
  Master Dwarf. 
 
     GIMLI 
   (indignant) 
  Recover my... 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
159. 
 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS turns to ARAGORN with urgency. 
 
     LEGOLAS 
  We should leave now. 
 
     ARAGORN 
  No. Orcs patrol the eastern shore. We  
  must wait for cover of darkness. 
 
     LEGOLAS 
  It is not the Eastern shore that    
  worries me.  
 
LEGOLAS casts a glance around into the PARTH GALEN forest... 
 
     LEGOLAS 
  A shadow and a threat has been growing  
  in my mind. Something draws near, I can  
  feel it. 
 
ARAGORN looks at LEGOLAS, knowing full well what he means. 
 
ANGLE ON: SAM has slumped asleep. MERRY dumps a small pile of 
kindling at GIMLI’S feet.... 
 
     MERRY 
  Where’s Frodo? 
 
SAM sits up with a start ... ARAGORN’S head snaps around. His 
eyes fly to BOROMIR’S shield which lies abandoned by his camp 
bed.  
 
CLOSE ON: ARAGORN ... as he realizes BOROMIR has gone! 
 
EXT. SLOPES OF AMON HEN - DAY 
 
FRODO is walking beneath the trees ... lost in thought. His feet 
hit the rough edge of an ancient stone slab ... his eyes follow 
an overgrown path towards stone stairs leading to the SUMMIT OF 
AMON HEN ... the seeing seat.  
 
A CRACKLING SOUND! FRODO freezes... 
 
     BOROMIR 
   (quietly) 
  None of us should wander alone; you  
  least of all. So much depends on you   
  ... Frodo?  
 
      (CONTINUED) 
160. 
 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO turns slowly ... he stares at BOROMIR, tense, 
cautious. 
 
     BOROMIR 
  I know why you seek solitude. You  
  suffer, I see it day by day. Are you  
  sure you do not suffer needlessly?  
 
FRODO stands silent for a moment ... the murmur of the WIND in 
the trees and the distant roar of the FALLS OF RAUROS can be 
heard. 
 
     BOROMIR 
  Let me help you. There are other ways,  
  Frodo ... other paths that we might  
  take. 
 
     FRODO 
  I know what you would say, and it would  
  sound like wisdom but for the warning  
  of my heart. 
 
     BOROMIR 
  Warning? Against what?  
 
BOROMIR has started forward towards FRODO. FRODO backs away from 
him. 
 
     BOROMIR (CONT’D) 
  We’re all afraid, Frodo. But to let  
  that fear drive us to destroy what hope  
  we have ... don't you see that is  
  madness? 
 
     FRODO 
  There is no other way. 
 
     BOROMIR 
  I ask only for the strength to defend  
  my people. 
   (angrily drops the wood he  
    has collected) 
  If you would but lend me the Ring... 
 
     FRODO 
  No... 
 
FRODO steps hurriedly away from BOROMIR. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
161. 
 
 
CONTINUED: (2) 
 
     BOROMIR 
  Why do you recoil? I am no thief. 
 
     FRODO 
   (wary) 
  You are not yourself. 
 
     BOROMIR 
  What chance do you think you have? They  
  will find you, they will take the Ring  
  and you will beg for death before the  
  end. 
 
FRODO turns to leave. 
 
     BOROMIR (CONT’D) 
  You fool! It is not yours, save by  
  unhappy chance. It might have been  
  mine! It should be mine! Give it to me!  
  Give me the Ring. 
 
BOROMIR leaps on top of FRODO, grasping for the RING! FRODO has 
only moments to act. FRODO rips the RING from around his neck 
... and rams it on his finger. 
 
FRODO DISAPPEARS.  
 
BOROMIR spins wildly around, yelling into thin air! 
 
     BOROMIR 
  I see your mind ... you will take the  
  Ring to Sauron. You will betray us!  
  You go to your death and the death of  
  us all! Curse you! Curse you and all  
  your Halflings! 
 
BOROMIR stumbles and falls. His body shakes as if in the THROES 
of a fit ... slowly, he comes to. 
 
     BOROMIR (CONT’D) 
   (disoriented) 
  Frodo! Frodo! What have I done? Please,  
  Frodo... 
 
162. 
 
 
EXT. SEEING SEAT - DAY 
 
IN THE TWILIGHT WORLD: FRODO races through the misty Twilight 
world, past the foggy shapes of twisted trees. Somewhere behind 
him, Boromir’s distraught voice carries, as if from another 
dimension. 
 
     BOROMIR (O.S.) 
  I’m sorry, Frodo ... Frodo... 
 
FRODO suddenly finds himself on the stone steps ... he clambers 
up the stairs, onto a high seat, perched on four stone pillars. 
FRODO cowers on the seat, like a lost child upon the throne of 
mountain kings. The world of mist swirls around him.  
 
FRODO peers out from the seat ... the world seems to shrink. In 
all directions, VIEWS of far off lands TELESCOPE towards him 
through the mist. 
 
IMAGES: ORCS spilling out of holes in the MISTY MOUNTAINS ... 
FLAMES rise from MIRKWOOD ... Grim faced EASTERLINGS march to 
war ... BLACK SHIPS sail to the South. All the power of the Dark 
Lord is in motion.  
 
FRODO moves his gaze to the East ... FIRE explodes against the 
smoke, as a huge mass of black battlements fills Frodo’s vision. 
A mountain of iron, immeasurably strong, tower of adamant: 
BARAD-DÛR, the fortress of SAURON. 
 
SUDDENLY! SAURON’S EYE LEAPS TOWARD FRODO LIKE A FINGER OF 
LIGHT. 
 
     SAURON (V.O.) 
   (IN BLACK SPEECH) 
  They will fall! 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO leaps off the seat, and tumbles down the stairs! 
The EYE sweeps AMON HEN like a searchlight, seeking its RING! 
With a huge effort, FRODO wrenches the RING off his finger... 
 
EXT. SUMMIT OF AMON HEN - DAY 
 
FRODO lies gasping on the SUMMIT OF AMON HEN ... below the 
ancient ruins of the seeing seat.  
 
AT THAT MOMENT: A BLACK BOOT STEPS INTO SHOT! 
 
FRODO looks up as ARAGORN towers over him. 
 
     ARAGORN 
  Frodo? 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
163. 
 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
     FRODO 
   (numb) 
  It has taken Boromir. 
 
ARAGORN moves towards FRODO... 
 
     ARAGORN 
   (urgent) 
  Where is the Ring? 
 
FRODO backs away from ARAGORN ... ARAGORN is shocked by the 
movement. 
 
     FRODO 
  Stay away! 
 
     ARAGORN 
  Frodo ... I swore to protect you.  
 
     FRODO 
  Can you protect me from yourself?  
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO uncurls his fist ... in his palm lies the RING!  
It glints, gold and beautiful in the afternoon sun ... ARAGORN’S 
eyes are drawn to it. 
 
     FRODO (CONT’D) 
  Would you destroy it? 
 
     THE RING 
  Aragorn. Aragorn. Elessar. 
 
     ARAGORN 
   (kneeling to Frodo) 
  I would have gone with you to the end 
  ... into the very fires of Mordor. 
 
     FRODO 
  I know. Look after the others, especially  
  Sam ... he will not understand. 
 
ARAGORN FREEZES! He draws his sword. 
 
     ARAGORN 
   (urgent) 
  Go, Frodo! 
 
FRODO hesitates. 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
164. 
 
 
CONTINUED: (2) 
 
     ARAGORN 
   (yells) 
  Run. Run! 
 
FRODO backs away into the trees... 
 
ANGLE ON: ...as 200 URUK-HAI SWARM onto AMON HEN behind ARAGORN! 
 
ARAGORN attacks the leading URUK-HAI like a madman ... he brings 
two down with his sword leaping into the ruins as others close 
in on him.  
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO scrambles down the HILLSIDE, away from the 
fight. 
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN battles the URUK-HAI, amongst the pillars and 
blocks of AMON HEN. Despite his bravery, he is quickly 
surrounded. 
 
SUDDENLY: ELVEN ARROWS smash into the URUK-HAI. LEGOLAS races 
out of the woods, firing his bow. GIMLI leaps into the battle, 
wielding his mighty axe. 
 
EXT. PARTH GALEN HILLSIDE - DAY 
 
FRODO is darting down the steep hillside as heavy feet thunder 
down after him. 
 
     SAM 
  Mr. Frodo! 
 
ANGLE ON: SAM looks around for FRODO. 
 
CLOSE ON: LURTZ ordering his URUKS. 
 
     LURTZ 
  Find the Halflings ... find the  
  Halflings! 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO stumbles and falls ... quickly he crawls behind 
a tree ... above him the sound of URUK-HAI crashing through the 
forest rings out. 
 
     MERRY (O.S.) 
   (urgent whisper) 
  Frodo! 
 
FRODO turns to see MERRY and PIPPIN hiding in a hollow, a few 
feet away.

CONTINUED: 
 
      MERRY (CONT’D)  
  Hide here, quick! 
 
      PIPPIN 
  Come on! 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO looks at his friends ... slowly shakes his head, 
a great sadness in his eyes.  
 
     PIPPIN (CONT’D) 
  What's he doing? 
 
ANGLE ON: MERRY’S eyes meets FRODO’S. Understanding. 
 
     MERRY 
   (softly) 
  He's leaving. 
 
     PIPPIN 
  No! 
 
PIPPIN stands and makes a move toward FRODO .. MERRY grabs at 
his arm. 
 
     MERRY 
  Pippin! 
 
ANGLE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN look up the slope where a cry has 
rings out. THEY HAVE BEEN SEEN! 
 
     MERRY 
   (to Frodo) 
  Run, Frodo. Go on! 
 
MERRY waves his arms at the approaching ORCS. 
 
     MERRY 
  Hey, hey you! Over here!  
 
     PIPPIN 
  Hey! 
 
     MERRY 
  Over here! 
 
     PIPPIN 
  This way! 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
166.

MERRY and PIPPIN run, leading a pack of ORCS.  
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO runs to the lake. 
 
ANGLE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN, still running from the ORCS 
 
     PIPPIN 
  It's working! 
 
     MERRY 
  I know it's working! Run! 
 
MERRY and PIPPIN stop ... more URUK-HAI approach from the other 
direction ... THEY ARE TRAPPED. 
 
SUDDENLY! BOROMIR charges up the hillside and blocks the stroke 
of the leading URUK-HAI.  
 
ANGLE ON: THE ECHO OF BOROMIR’S HORN reaches ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, 
and GIMLI ... they are battling their way down the SLOPES 
towards the lake. 
 
     LEGOLAS 
  The horn of Gondor! 
 
     ARAGORN 
  Boromir! 
 
ARAGORN desperately slashes his way towards BOROMIR, felling 
URUK-HAI in his path ... while LEGOLAS and GIMLI fight a REAR 
GUARD ACTION. 
 
ANGLE ON: Many URUK-HAI fall to BOROMIR’S sword as he tries to 
protect MERRY and PIPPIN... 
 
     BOROMIR 
  Run! Run! 
 
ANGLE ON: LURTZ takes aim. 
 
ANGLE ON: A BLACK ARROW suddenly THUDS into BOROMIR’S chest. 
Amazingly, BOROMIR continues fighting, but another arrow ... and 
another, brings him to his knees. 
 
ANGLE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN are scooped off their feet by URUK- 
HAI.

     MERRY & PIPPIN 
  Aaaaagh! Boromir! Boromir! 
 
ANGLE ON: LURTZ aims his bow at BOROMIR’S heart ... suddenly 
ARAGORN charges at him, smashing the BOW with his sword. They 
lock into a deadly battle.  
 
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN cuts LURTZ down and races towards BOROMIR, who 
lies slumped against a tree ... URUK-HAI arrows sticking out of 
his chest. 
 
At least 20 dead URUK-HAI lie heaped around BOROMIR. His horn 
lies at his feet ... CLOVEN in two. 
 
     BOROMIR 
   (painful gasp) 
  They took the little ones... 
 
ARAGORN quickly tries to staunch the flow of BLOOD from 
BOROMIR’S shoulder. 
 
     BOROMIR (CONT’D) 
   (panicked) 
  Frodo ... where is Frodo? 
 
     ARAGORN 
  I let Frodo go. 
 
BOROMIR holds Aragorn’s gaze. 
 
     BOROMIR 
  Then you did what I could not. I tried  
  to take the Ring from him. 
 
     ARAGORN 
  The Ring is beyond our reach now. 
 
     BOROMIR 
  Forgive me. I did not see ... I have  
  failed you all. 
 
     ARAGORN 
  No, Boromir. You fought bravely. You  
  have kept your honor. 
 
ARAGORN tries to bind BOROMIR’S wound.

     BOROMIR 
  Leave it! It is over ... the world of  
  Men will fall and all will come to  
  darkness and my city to ruin ...  
  Aragorn...   
 
     ARAGORN 
  I do not know what strength is in my  
  blood, but I swear to you ... I will  
  not let the White City fall, nor your  
  people fail... 
 
     BOROMIR 
  Our people ... our people... 
 
ARAGORN places BOROMIR’S sword in his hand. BOROMIR’S fingers 
tighten around the hilt. 
 
     BOROMIR (CONT’D) 
  I would have followed you, my brother    
  ... my captain, my king. 
 
ARAGORN lays BOROMIR down. He is dead. 
 
     ARAGORN 
  Be at peace, son of Gondor.  
 
ARAGORN bends and KISSES BOROMIR’S forehead.  
 
LEGOLAS and GIMLI appear behind him ... ARAGORN stands. 
 
     ARAGORN (CONT’D) 
  They will look for his coming from the  
  White Tower ... but he will not return. 
 
EXT. SHORE OF NEN HITHOEL - DAY 
 
On the lakeshore, FRODO stands in front of one of the ELVISH 
boats, the RING in his palm.  
 
ANGLE ON: A distraught SAM ... running as hard as he can through 
the forest... 
 
     SAM 
  Mr. Frodo!

169. 
 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO looks to the far side of the river ... the 
CAMERA moves in on the RING. 
 
     FRODO (V.O.) 
  I wish the Ring had never come to me. I  
  wish none of this had happened... 
 
Tears fall down FRODO’S face... 
 
     GANDALF (V.O.) 
  So do all who live to see such times...  
  but that is not for them to decide. All  
  we have to decide is what to do with  
  the time that is given us. 
 
With renewed determination, FRODO tucks the RING inside his vest 
pocket.  
 
ANGLE ON: The small figure of FRODO pushing the ELVISH boat into 
the water... 
 
ANGLE ON: SAM bursts through the trees and runs toward the lake 
... FRODO is already paddling away. 
 
     SAM 
   (anguished) 
  Not alone, Frodo. Mr. Frodo!  
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO, in the boat, paddling steadfastly away from the 
shore ... tears in his eyes ... the voice of SAM carried on the 
wind. FRODO whispers to himself. 
 
     FRODO 
  No, Sam. 
 
ANGLE ON: SAM looks at the water ... then at the boat.  
 
SPLASH! FRODO turns to see SAM launching himself into the water. 
 
     FRODO 
  Go back, Sam! I'm going to Mordor alone. 
 
ANGLE ON: SAM splashes hopelessly toward the boat. 
 
     SAM 
  Of course you are ... and I'm coming  
  with you!

boat... 
 
     FRODO (CONT’D) 
   (frightened) 
  Sam! 
 
ANGLE ON: SAM is underwater ... hands flailing helplessly as he 
sinks. 
 
CLOSE ON: FRODO’S hand grasping SAM’S... 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO pulls a bedraggled and half-drowned SAM into the 
boat. FRODO and SAM look at each other, out of breath, tears and 
water streaming down both their faces. 
   
     SAM 
  I made a promise, Mr. Frodo ... a  
  promise. 
   (fierce passion) 
  “Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee.” 
   (sobs) 
  And I don't mean to ... I don't  
  mean to. 
 
     FRODO 
   (crying) 
  Oh, Sam! 
 
FRODO starts to laugh through his tears ... the two friends hug.  
 
     FRODO (CONT’D) 
  Come on then... 
 
The two HOBBITS row through the water... 
 
EXT. FALLS OF RAUROS AERIAL - DAY 
 
SLOW MOTION: Looking down on swiftly flowing water ... BOROMIR’S 
body slides under CAMERA. 
 
He is lying in one of the boats, his arms across his chest ... 
his broken horn at his side.  
 
      (CONTINUED) 
171. 
 
 
CONTINUED:  
 
SUDDENLY... the boat drops away from CAMERA ... as it plunges 
over the massive FALLS OF RAUROS, disappearing into the vapor 
below. 
 
EXT. SHORE OF NEN HITHOEL - DAY 
 
ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS pushes the last boat into the water. 
 
     LEGOLAS 
  If we are quick, we will catch Frodo 
  and Sam before nightfall. 
 
ARAGORN looks toward the far shore: FRODO and SAM’S small boat 
can be seen lying on the distant RIVERBANK as FRODO and SAM make 
off into the forest beyond. He doesn’t react.  
 
ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS turns and looks at ARAGORN. 
 
     LEGOLAS (CONT’D) 
  You mean not to follow them... 
 
     ARAGORN 
  Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands. 
 
     GIMLI 
  Then it has all been in vain ... the  
  Fellowship has failed. 
 
     ARAGORN 
  Not if we hold true to each other. We  
  will not abandon Merry and Pippin to  
  torment and death, not while we have  
  strength left.  
 
ARAGORN pulls a HUNTING KNIFE out of his pack and straps it on. 
 
     ARAGORN 
  Leave all that can be spared behind.  
 
CLOSE ON: ARAGORN ... a steely light in his eye. 
 
     ARAGORN (CONT’D) 
   (grimly) 
  We travel light. Let’s hunt some Orc.  
 
     GIMLI 
  Yes! Ha! 
 
      (CONTINUED) 
172. 
 
 
CONTINUED: 
 
ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI disappear into the WOODS, following 
the URUK-HAI trail. 
 
EXT. EMYN MUIL HILLTOP - DAY 
 
FRODO and SAM scramble onto a high ridge. 
 
WIDE ON: A distant line of SAW TOOTHED mountains below a dark, 
oppressive sky. Black volcanic smoke rises behind the mountains 
... MORDOR! 
 
ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM look with grim determination. 
 
     FRODO 
  Mordor! I hope the others find a safer  
  road. 
 
     SAM 
   (simply) 
  Strider’ll look after them. 
 
     FRODO 
  I don't suppose we'll ever see them 
   again. 
 
     SAM 
  We may yet, Mr. Frodo. We may. 
 
     FRODO 
  Sam? 
 
FRODO looks at SAM with great affection ... despite the grim 
outlook, SAM is undeterred... 
 
     FRODO (CONT’D) 
  I'm glad you're with me. 
 
WIDE ON: THE TWO HOBBITS SETTING OFF TOWARD MORDOR.

               BLACK SCREEN:

               EXT. RIVER ANDUIN - DAY

               ANGLE ON: SMEAGOL and his cousin, DEAGOL, sit in a SMALL 
               CORACLE, their FISHING LINES draped over the side... SUNSHINE 
               glinting off the surface of the water.

               An idyllic image.

               SUDDENLY... DEAGOL's FISHING ROD BENDS under the weight of a 
               LARGE FISH.

                                     DEAGOL
                              (excited)
                         Smeagol, I've got one!
                              (he laughs)
                         I've got a fish, Smeagol!

                                     SMEAGOL
                              (excitedly)
                         Go on, pull it in.

               DEAGOL pulls on his ROD, but is HAULED OVERBOARD and 
               disappears underwater with a SPLASH!

               ANGLE ON: SMEAGOL leaning over the BOAT... CONCERNED.

                                     SMEAGOL
                              (worried)
                         Deagol!

               EXT. UNDERWATER, RIVER ANDUIN - DAY

               ANGLE ON: DEAGOL is towed to the RIVER BED by a LARGE FISH... 
               he suddenly lets go of the line... eyes fixed on a SHINING 
               GOLD RING, lying in the SILT.

               EXT. RIVER ANDUIN, GLADDEN FIELDS - DAY

               CLOSE ON: DEAGOL climbs out of the WATER, onto the RIVER 
               BANK.

               CLOSE ON: the RING revealed in DEAGOL'S PALM...

               ANGLE ON: SMEAGOL peers over his shoulder... the GOLD reflects 
               in SMEAGOL'S EYES!

               ON SOUNDTRACK: The HUM of the RING growing LOUDER...

                                     SMEAGOL
                         Give us that, Deagol, my love!

               DEAGOL turns to look at him, a smirk on his face.

                                     DEAGOL
                         Why?

               CLOSE ON: SMEAGOL moves towards DEAGOL...

                                     SMEAGOL
                         Because its my birthday, and I wants 
                         it.

               ANGLE ON: SMEAGOL jumps on DEAGOL...STRANGLING HIM! 

               SMEAGOL rips the GLITTERING RING from DEAGOL'S LIMP HAND.

                                     SMEAGOL
                         My precious!

               CLOSE ON: SMEAGOL slips the RING onto his FINGER and 
               DISAPPEARS.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. MISTY MOUNTAINS CAVES - DAY

               IMAGES: SMEAGOL descending into madness. His body TWISTS and 
               DISTORTS... he becomes a CREEPY, SHRIVELLED wretch... finally 
               crawling into a DARK CAVE beneath the MISTY MOUNTAINS.

                                     SMEAGOL (V.O.)
                         They cursed us. Murderer. Murderer 
                         they called us. They cursed us and 
                         drove us away. And we wept, Precious, 
                         we wept to be so alone. And we forgot 
                         the taste of bread, the sound of 
                         trees, the softness of the wind... 
                         We even forgot our own name.
                              (in a choking cough)
                         Gollum! Gollum!

               ANGLE ON: GOLLUM in the CAVE staring at the RING in his hand.

                                     GOLLUM
                         It's mine! My own. It came to me.

                                     SMEAGOL
                              (ecstatic)
                         My Precious.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. CULVERT, VALE OF MORGUL - DAWN

               ANGLE ON: A GRIM LANDSCAPE, covered in THORN BUSHES and the 
               scars of RECENT FIRES. The DARK MORGUL VALLEY disappears up 
               towards the MOUNTAINS.

               SETTLE ON: FRODO and SAM in a FILTHY CULVERT.

               SAM twitches in a RESTLESS SLEEP. But FRODO is awake... His 
               hand trails down to the CHAIN around his NECK...

               A SUDDEN HISS! FRODO quickly hides the RING as GOLLUM peers 
               at them with GLEAMING EYES.

                                     GOLLUM
                         Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, sleepies! 
                         We must go, yes, we must go at once!

               SAM STIRS, looks at FRODO...

                                     SAM
                         Haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?

               FRODO shakes his HEAD.

                                     SAM
                         I've gone and had too much!

               SAM looks at the dead, BROWN TWILIGHT, below the LOWERING 
               CLOUD.

                                     SAM
                         It must be getting late.

                                     FRODO
                         No... no it isn't. It isn't midday 
                         yet.

               The days are growing darker.

               The GROUND suddenly QUIVERS, as a ROLLING, RUMBLING NOISE 
               ECHOES down the VALLEY.

                                     GOLLUM
                         Come on, must go, no time...

                                     SAM
                         Not before Mr. Frodo's had something 
                         to eat.

                                     GOLLUM
                         ...no time to lose, silly.

               SAM shoots GOLLUM a HOSTILE LOOK and turns back to rummage 
               in his KNAPSACK. He holds up a piece of dried LEMBAS BREAD 
               to FRODO.

                                     SAM
                         Here.

                                     FRODO
                         What about you?

                                     SAM
                              (lying badly)
                         I'm not hungry -- leastways, not for 
                         lembas bread.

                                     FRODO
                         Sam.

                                     SAM
                              (confessing)
                         Alright. We don't have that much 
                         left. We have to be careful or we're 
                         going to run out. You go ahead and 
                         eat that, Mr. Frodo. I've rationed 
                         it. There should be enough.

               FRODO looks at SAM questioningly.

                                     FRODO
                         For what?

                                     SAM
                         The journey home.

               FRODO says nothing.

               EXT. CULVERT, VALE OF MORGUL - DAY

               WIDE: FRODO and SAM follow GOLLUM as he leads them on the 
               wining, torturous path... clambering through BRACKEN and 
               over JAGGED ROCKS.

                                     GOLLUM
                         Come, Hobbitses. Very close now. 
                         Very close to Mordor! No safe places 
                         here. Hurry! Shhh.

               EXT. THE FOREST OF ISENGARD - DAY

               GANDALF leads ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, THEODEN and GIMLI through 
               dark woodland...

               The MOVING FOREST of FANGORN... opens before them... creating 
               an AVENUE of TREES, which allows them access along the old 
               ISENGARD ROAD. A THICK, HUMID MIST fills the forest.

               SUPER: The Return of the King

               ANGLE ON: The FOEST SEPARATES ahead, REVEALING: the RUINS of 
               ISENGARD.

               EXT. ISENGARED GATE - DAY

               WIDE ON: All about, the GREAT STONE WALL is cracked and 
               splintered into countless jagged shards.

               Far off, half veiled int he swirling STEAM, the TOWER of 
               ORTHANC stands... Unbroken by the storm. Pale waters lap 
               about its feet.

               ANGLE ON: TWO SMALL HOBBITS are sitting on the SMASHED WALL

               ...MERRY and PIPPIN! SPREAD before them is a feast of BREADS, 
               MEATS and WINE. They PUFF on long pipes as they lie back in 
               the SUN.

                                     PIPPIN
                         I feel like I'm back at the Green 
                         Dragon, after a hard days work.

                                     MERRY
                         Only, you've never done a hard days 
                         work.

               MERRY cuts PIPPIN off before he can respond in kind.

                                     MERRY
                         Welcome, my Lords, to Isengard.

               ANGLE ON: GANDALF, ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI stare at the 
               SIGHT before them...

                                     GIMLI
                         You young rascals! A merry hunt you've 
                         led us on, and now we find you 
                         feasting and smoking.

                                     PIPPIN
                              (mouth full)
                         We are sitting on a field of victory, 
                         enjoying a few well-earned comforts. 
                         The salted pork is particularly good.

                                     GIMLI
                              (suddenly interested)
                         Salted pork?

                                     GANDALF
                              (shaking his head)
                         Hobbits!

                                     MERRY
                         We're under orders from Treebeard, 
                         who's taken over management of 
                         Isengard.

               WIDE: GANDALF leads the company through the flotsam and jetsam 
               which floats upon the muddied waters surrounding the TOWER... 
               TREEBEARD, the GIANT ENT, strides towards them, ALARMING all 
               but GANDALF.

                                     TREEBEARD
                         Huraroom... Young Master Gandalf, 
                         I'm glad you've come. Wood and water, 
                         stock and stone I can master, but 
                         there's a wizard to be managed here... 
                         Locked in his tower.

                                     GANDALF
                         And there Saruman must remain, under 
                         your guard, Treebeard.

                                     GIMLI
                         Let's just have his head and be done 
                         with it.

               GANDALF stares up the long length of the DARK TOWER...

                                     GANDALF
                              (quietly)
                         No. He has no power any more.

               THE OLD ENT nods his head wisely...

                                     TREEBEARD
                         The filth of Saruman is washing 
                         away... Trees will come back to live 
                         here, young trees... wild trees.

               CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, his eye caught by something lying in the 
               WATER

               ANGLE ON: The MUDDY waters GLOWING wit a golden light...

               ARAGORN turns as, quick as a FLASH, PIPPIN has jumped off 
               his horse and picked up -- the PALANTIR!

                                     TREEBEARD
                         Well bless my bark!

                                     GANDALF
                              (urgent)
                         Peregrin Took! I'll take that, my 
                         lad!

               PIPPIN doesn't move, his eyes staring in wonder at the smooth 
               black stone...

                                     GANDALF
                         Quickly, now!

               RELUCTANTLY, PIPPIN hands the PALANTIR to GANDALF... who 
               immediately smothers it in his cloak.

               ANGLE ON: GANDALF looks back at PIPPIN... troubled.

               EXT. EDORAS - DAY

               WIDE: BACK SHOT - a GROUP OF RIDERS gallop towards the ROHAN 
               CITY of EDORAS...

               PUSH IN: EOWYN standing alone outside the GOLDEN HALL, 
               waiting...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EDORAS, GOLDEN HALL - EVENING

               WIDE: A ROARING FIRE; a LAMB ROASTING on SPIT; LONG TABLES 
               laden with FOOD; BARRELS of WINE; a banquet is-laid ready 
               for the returning soldiers.

                                     THEODEN
                         Tonight we remember those who gave 
                         their blood to defend this country. 
                         Hail the victorious dead!

               ANGLE ON: Amidst the cheering crowd, EOWYN moves towards 
               ARAGORN... As she proffers the CHALICE their eyes meet.

                                     EOWYN
                         Westu Aragorn hal.

               EOWYN watches as ARAGORN moves away... a voice speaks in her 
               ear.

                                     THEODEN
                         I am happy for you.

               EOWYN looks at her UNCLE, as THEODEN follows her gaze.

                                     THEODEN
                         He is an honourable man.

                                     EOWYN
                              (smiling)
                         You are both honourable men.

                                     THEODEN
                         It was not Theoden of Rohan who led 
                         our people to victory.

               EOWYN looks at him questioningly, disturbed by his tone.

                                     THEODEN
                         Don't listen to me -- you are young, 
                         and tonight is for you.

               ANGLE ON: EOWYN watches concerned as her UNCLE moves away.

               ANGLE ON: MERRY & PIPPIN are in full voice, on top of one of 
               the TABLES... both hold very large mugs of ALE in their hands.

                                     MERRY & PIPPIN
                              (singing)
                         Oh, you can search -- up and down 
                         As many lands as can be found 
                         But you'll never find a beer so brown 
                         As the one we drink in our home town 
                         You can keep your fancy ales 
                         You can drink them by the flagon 
                         But the only brew, for the brave and 
                         true 
                         Comes from the Green Dragon!

               ANGLE ON: GANDALF laughing and clapping the HOBBITS. ARAGORN 
               steps up beside him, SMILING at the floorshow.

                                     ARAGORN
                         No news of Frodo?

                                     GANDALF
                         No word... nothing.

                                     ARAGORN
                         We will have time.

               GANDALF turns quickly to ARAGORN.

                                     ARAGORN
                         Every day Frodo moves closer to 
                         Mordor.

               GANDALF watches his friend's face... seeking reassurance.

                                     GANDALF
                         Do we know that?

                                     ARAGORN
                              (gently)
                         What does your heart tell you?

                                     GANDALF
                              (with a small smile)
                         That Frodo is alive.
                              (to himself)
                         Yes -- yes, he is alive.

               EXT. MORGUL VALLEY - NIGHT

               ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM lie asleep amidst scrubby bushes 
               near a stagnant pool. SMEAGOL lies nearby, muttering in his 
               sleep.

                                     SMEAGOL
                         Too risky, too risky. The thieves! 
                         They stole it from us. Kill them... 
                         kill them... kill them both!

               SMEAGOL wakes suddenly, shaking, his face drenched in SWEAT, 
               eyes wide in horror.

                                     SMEAGOL
                         No!

                                     GOLLUM
                              (hissed whisper)
                         Shhh! Quiet!

               SMEAGOL'S features suddenly transform into the MALEVOLENT 
               face of GOLLUM!

                                     GOLLUM
                         Mustn't wake them, mustn't ruin it 
                         now!

               SMEAGOL casts a quick glance over his SHOULDER to the SLEEPING 
               figures of FRODO and SAM as he clambers off his ROCK... 
               silently sidling towards the EDGE of a STAGNANT POOL.

                                     SMEAGOL
                         They knows, they knows, they suspects 
                         us.

               SMEAGOL stares into the MURKY depths of the WATER.

               The SURFACE RIPPLES as the face of GOLLUM appears as SMEAGOL'S 
               REFLECTION.

                                     GOLLUM
                         What is it saying, my Precious, my 
                         love? Is Smeagol losing his nerve??

                                     SMEAGOL
                         No! Not! Never!! Smeagol hates nasty 
                         Hobbitses! Smeagol wants to see them 
                         dead!

                                     GOLLUM
                         And we will -- Smeagol did it once...
                              (sly)
                         ...He can do it again.

               FLASH INSERT: SMEAGOL choking DEAGOL... Fingers locked tight 
               around his THROAT.

                                     GOLLUM
                         It's ours -- ours!

                                     SMEAGOL
                         We must get the Precious. We must 
                         get it back.

                                     GOLLUM
                         Patience, patience, my love. First 
                         we must lead them to her.

                                     SMEAGOL
                         We lead them to the windy stairs.

                                     GOLLUM
                              (prompting)
                         Yes, the stairs... and then?

                                     SMEAGOL
                         Up, up, up, up the stairs we go... 
                         until we come to...
                              (naughty excitement)
                         ...the Tunnel!

                                     GOLLUM
                              (quiet)
                         And when they go in, there's no coming 
                         out. She's always hungry, she always 
                         needs to feed. She must eat, all She 
                         gets is filthy Orcses.

                                     SMEAGOL
                         And they doesn't taste very nice, 
                         does they, Precious?

                                     GOLLUM
                              (sinister)
                         No... not very nice at all, my love. 
                         She hungers for sweeter meats...

               CLOSE ON: SAM... his EYES flicker OPEN...

                                     GOLLUM
                         "Hobbit meat." And when She throws 
                         away the bones and the empty clothes, 
                         then we will find it...

                                     SMEAGOL
                         And take it for Me!

                                     GOLLUM
                              (correcting)
                         For us...

                                     SMEAGOL
                         Yes, we, we meant for us...
                              (choking cough)
                         Go Hum! Go Hum!

                                     GOLLUM
                              (sly)
                         The Precious will be ours once the 
                         Hobbitses are dead!

               SUDDEN ANGLE ON: SAM image mirrored in the water as he SMACKS 
               GOLLUM on the HEAD with his POT!

                                     SAM
                              (yelling)
                         You treacherous little toad!

               SAM drops the POT and FLINGS himself ON TOP of GOLLUM! GOLLUM 
               SCREAMS... his ARMS and LEGS FLAILING WILDLY!

                                     GOLLUM
                              (crying)
                         No! Not! Help! Master!

               ANGLE ON: FRODO staggers over to SAM and PULLS HIM OFF GOLLUM.

                                     FRODO
                         No, Sam! Leave him alone!

               CLOSE ON: GOLLUM, huddled on the ground SOBBING and 
               WHIMPERING.

                                     SAM
                              (fuming)
                         I heard it from his own mouth he 
                         means to murder us!

                                     SMEAGOL
                         Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly! 
                         He's a horrid, fat Hobbit who hates 
                         Smeagol and who makes up nasty lies!

               SAM makes for SMEAGOL again... with a look of MURDEROUS RAGE.

                                     SAM
                         You miserable little maggot! I'll 
                         stove your head in!

               FRODO grabs SAM'S ARM.

                                     FRODO
                         Sam...

                                     SAM
                         Call me a liar! You're a liar!

                                     FRODO
                         Sam! If you scare him off, we're 
                         lost.

               SAM pulls away from FRODO...

                                     SAM
                         I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. 
                         Frodo. I won' t wait around for him 
                         to kill us!

                                     FRODO
                              (fierce whisper)
                         I'm not sending him away.

               SAM stares at FRODO... at a loss.

                                     SAM
                         You don't see it, do you? He's a 
                         villain!

                                     FRODO
                              (lowers voice)
                         We can't do this by ourselves, Sam. 
                         Not without a guide. I need you on 
                         my side.

               ANGLE ON: SAM, his face softening.

                                     SAM
                              (taken aback)
                         I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.

                                     FRODO
                         I know, Sam, I know.
                              (whisper)
                         You must trust me.

               FRODO beckons to GOLLUM.

                                     FRODO
                         Come, Smeagol.

               GOLLUM turns slowly, staring at SAM through hooded, HATE-
               FILLED EYES... and SMILES.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. EDORAS, GOLDEN HALL - EARLY DAWN

               ARAGORN joins LEGOLAS on the STEPS to the GOLDEN HALL, 
               oblivious to the CHILL WIND... they look out across the 
               SLEEPING CITY to the LOOMING MOUNTAIN RANGE BEYOND... DARK 
               CLOUDS mark the sky.

                                     LEGOLAS
                         The stars are veiled, something stirs 
                         in the east... A sleepless malice.

               LEGOLAS looks at ARAGORN... realisation in his face.

                                     LEGOLAS
                         The eye of the enemy is moving.

               INT. EDORAS, SLEEPING QUARTERS - EARLY DAWN

               CLOSE ON: PIPPIN... he is AWAKE! He sits up... ANXIOUS, 
               FIDGETY...

               Suddenly he hops out of bed and creeps towards the SLEEPING 
               FORM of GANDALF.

                                     MERRY
                              (whispers)
                         What you doing?

               PIPPIN gasps with FRIGHT! MERRY is sitting up, wiping sleep 
               from his eyes. He moves on...

               ANGLE ON: A sleeping GANDALF lies with eyes wide open! But 
               PIPPIN is undeterred...

               MERRY sits up, a worried look on his face.

                                     MERRY
                         Pippin? Pippin? Pippin! What are you 
                         doing?

               With quick stealth, PIPPIN lifts the WRAPPED PALANTIR from 
               GANDALF'S grasp...

                                     MERRY
                         Pippin, are you mad?

                                     PIPPIN
                         I just want to look at it. Just one 
                         more time.

                                     MERRY
                         Put it back! Put -- it -- back!

               PIPPIN unwraps the PALANTIR and as MERRY looks on HORRIFIED, 
               he gazes INTENTLY into it.

                                     MERRY
                         Pippin!

               As PIPPIN lays his hands on the CRYSTAL, a SICKLY PALE light 
               slowly spreads from the GLASS BALL onto PIPPIN'S FACE... his 
               EYES WIDEN.

                                     MERRY
                         Pippin!

               EXT. EDORAS GOLDEN HALL - EARLY DAWN

               On the STEPS of the GOLDEN HALL, LEGOLAS turns to ARAGORN.

                                     LEGOLAS
                              (urgent)
                         He is here.

               INT. EDORAS, SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT

               PIPPIN suddenly starts to HYPERVENTILATE... He STAGGERS 
               BACKWARDS, PALANTIR held rigidly before him...

               THE GREAT EYE OF SAURON seems to LEAP from the FIRE... PIPPIN 
               is bathed in the FIERY RED LIGHT.

               PIPPIN sinks to his KNEES, his mouth open in a soundless 
               SCREAM... He FALLS BACKWARDS, powerless to release the FIERY 
               GLOBE.

                                     MERRY
                         Help! Someone help him!

               GANDALF wakes with a start! Just as ARAGORN enters, and 
               wrenches the PALANTIR from PIPPIN'S HANDS... PIPPIN FALLS to 
               the FLOOR!... ARAGORN spins away, reeling backwards, the 
               PALANTIR falling from his HANDS...

               The PALANTIR rolls across the FLOOR, causing EVERYONE in the 
               room to COWER BACK.

               ANGLE ON: GANDALF throws a BLANKET over it, ANGRY DISBELIEF 
               on his face! He rounds on PIPPIN.

                                     GANDALF
                         Fool of a Took!

               GANDALF lifts the HOBBIT'S SLUMPED HEAD.

                                     MERRY
                         Pippin!

               PIPPIN is trembling... GANDALF calms him...

                                     PIPPIN
                         Gandalf! Forgive me.

                                     GANDALF
                         Look at me! What did you see?

                                     PIPPIN
                              (disjointed)
                         A tree... There was a white tree... 
                         in a courtyard of stone... It was 
                         dead!

               FLASH INSERT: A lone white tree silhouetted by flames.

                                     PIPPIN
                         The city was burning...

                                     GANDALF
                         Minas Tirith???
                              (to PIPPIN)
                         Is that what you saw?

                                     PIPPIN
                              (terrified)
                         I saw... I saw him... I could hear 
                         his voice in my head.

                                     GANDALF
                         And what did you tell him? Speak!

                                     PIPPIN
                         He asked me my name, I didn't 
                         answer... he hurt me...

               CLOSE ON: GANDALF stares at PIPPIN with a FRIGHTENING 
               INTENSITY...

                                     GANDALF
                         What did you tell him about Frodo 
                         and the Ring?

               INT. EDORAS, GOLDEN HALL - DAY

               THEODEN stands in the GOLDEN HALL, gravely listening to 
               GANDALF... ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI look on...

                                     GANDALF
                         There was no lie in Pippin's eyes; a 
                         fool, but an honest fool he remains. 
                         He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and 
                         the Ring.

               ANGLE ON: GIMLI lets out a sigh of relief.

               GANDALF turns to look at THEODEN.

                                     GANDALF
                         We've been strangely fortunate. What 
                         Pippin saw in the Palantir was a 
                         glimpse of our enemy's plan.

               GANDALF looks from on to the other of the, gathered company.

                                     GANDALF
                         Sauron moves to strike the city of 
                         Minas Tirith. His defeat at Helm's 
                         Deep showed our enemy one thing.

               The WIZARD turns towards ARAGORN...

                                     GANDALF
                         The heir of Elendil has come forth. 
                         Men are not as weak as he supposed. 
                         There is courage still -- strength 
                         enough left to challenge him.

               THEODEN listens intently, saying nothing.

                                     GANDALF
                              (warningly)
                         Sauron fears this. He will not risk 
                         the peoples of Middle-earth uniting 
                         under one banner. He will raise Minas 
                         Tirith to the ground before he sees 
                         the return of the King.

               CLOSE ON: ARAGORN... he knows GANDALF SPEAKS THE TRUTH.

               ANGLE ON: GANDALF rounds on THEODEN...

                                     GANDALF
                         If the beacons of Condor are lit, 
                         Rohan must be ready for war!

               THEODEN holds GANDALF'S gaze.

                                     THEODEN
                              (quietly)
                         Tell me. Why should we ride to the 
                         aid of those who did not come to 
                         ours?

               ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns to look at THEODEN.

                                     THEODEN
                         What do we owe Gondor?

                                     ARAGORN
                              (low and urgent)
                         I will go.

                                     GANDALF
                              (hurried)
                         No!

                                     ARAGORN
                         They must be warned.

                                     GANDALF
                         They will be.
                              (low voice, to Aragorn)
                         You must come to Minas Tirith by 
                         another road...
                              (cryptic)
                         Follow the river, look to the black 
                         ships.
                              (louder, to all)
                         Understand this... things are now in 
                         motion that cannot be undone.

               GANDALF turns on his heel... and stares at a surprised PIPPIN.

                                     GANDALF
                         I ride for Minas Tirith! And I won't 
                         be going alone!

               EXT. EDORAS STREETS - DAWN

               ANGLE ON: GANDALF hurries along the STREETS... PIPPIN and 
               MERRY run alongside trying to KEEP UP...

                                     GANDALF
                         Of all the inquisitive Hobbits, 
                         Peregrin Took, you are the worst. 
                         Hurry, hurry!

               PIPPIN catches up to MERRY.

                                     PIPPIN
                              (worried)
                         Where are we going?

                                     MERRY
                         Why did you look -- why do you always 
                         have to look?

                                     PIPPIN
                              (subdued)
                         I don't know... I can't help it.

               MERRY turns away...

                                     MERRY
                         You never can.

                                     PIPPIN
                              (lightly)
                         I'm sorry, alright? I won't do it 
                         again.

               This is too much for MERRY. He turns on PIPPIN.

                                     MERRY
                         Don't you understand... the Enemy 
                         thinks you have the Ring... he's 
                         going to be looking for you, Pip. 
                         They have to get you out of here!

                                     PIPPIN
                         And you. You're coming with me... 
                         Merry?

                                     MERRY
                         Come on!

               PUSH IN: PIPPIN'S face as MERRY strides away.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. EDORAS STABLES - DAWN

               ANGLE ON: PIPPIN is dumped unceremoniously onto the back of 
               SHADOWFAX as GANDALF hurriedly prepares to leave...

                                     PIPPIN
                              (nervous)
                         How far is Minas Tirith?

                                     GANDALF
                         Three days ride as the Nazgul flies 
                         and you'd better hope we don't have 
                         one of those on our tail.

               MERRY thrusts a SMALL PACKAGE into PIPPIN'S HAND...

                                     MERRY
                         Here -- something for the road.

               PIPPIN stares down at the leather-bound bundle of PIPE-WEED.

                                     PIPPIN
                         The last of the Longbottom Leaf.

                         I know you've run out... you smoke 
                         too much, Pip.

                                     PIPPIN
                         But we'll see each other soon?

               A WORRIED MERRY exchanges glances with GANDALF.

                                     PIPPIN
                         Won't we?

                                     MERRY
                         I don't know... I don't know what's 
                         going to happen.

               GANDALF mounts SHADOWFAX.

                                     PIPPIN
                              (rising panic)
                         Merry?

               GANDALF spurs the GREAT HORSE forward.

                                     GANDALF
                         Run Shadowfax, show us the meaning 
                         of haste.

                                     PIPPIN
                              (panicked)
                         Merry!

               SHADOWFAX thunders out of the STABLES!

               CLOSE ON: MERRY'S devastated face.

               EXT. GATES OF EDORAS - DAY

               ANGLE ON: SHADOWFAX carried GANDALF and PIPPIN out of the 
               GATE and down the WINDING ROAD towards the PLAINS QF ROHAN.

               EXT. EDORAS GATES LOOK-OUT - DAY

               ANGLE ON: MERRY clambers up a WATCHTOWER, ARAGORN in pursuit.

               ANGLE ON: The SMALL FIGURE as he watches his best friend 
               DISAPPEAR into the DISTANCE...

               CLOSE ON: ARAGORN... he knows what it is to lose someone.

               EXT. RIVENDELL FOREST - DAY

               WIDE: ARWEN -- escorted by a SMALL ENTOURAGE of ELVES -- 
               rides through the gathering darkness of a PINE FOREST ...

                                     ELROND (V.O.)
                         Take her by the safest road. A ship 
                         lies anchored in the Grey Havens. It 
                         waits to carry her across the Sea... 
                         The last journey of Arwen Undomiel.

               SLOW MOTION: As ARWEN rides through the FOREST the FIGURE of 
               a SMALL BOY of about 5 SUDDENLY runs across the path in front 
               of her.

               ARWEN reigns in ASFALOTH... something about the BOY intrigues 
               her -- but she does not know why...

               As ARWEN watches the BOY moves away, the TREES begin to 
               thin... the BOY continues running. One by one the TREES 
               TRANSFORM into TALL WHITE PILLARS...

               ARWEN'S POV: The BOY now stands within a VISION of the 
               majestic architecture of the great Gondorian city of MINAS 
               TIRITH.

               A SILHOUETTED FIGURE appears in the distance and moves towards 
               the CHILD... the BOY runs to the FIGURE.

               ARWEN watches as the FIGURE holds out its arms -- swinging 
               the LAUGHING CHILD into the AIR...

               The figure turns to reveal... ARAGORN, a little older, dressed 
               in the casual finery of a GONDORIAN NOBLE.

               CLOSE ON: The CHILD, now in ARAGORN'S ARMS looks directly at 
               ARWEN... it is a QUIET LOOK filled with INFINITE SADNESS.

               ARWEN'S eyes drop to the CHILD'S CHEST... around the CHILD'S 
               neck hangs the EVENSTAR...

               CLOSE ON: ARWEN as she realizes she is staring at a future 
               that can never be, the CHILD she and ARAGORN will never have.

               INSERT: ELROND speaking to his daughter...

                                     ELROND (V.O.)
                         Arwen, there is nothing for you 
                         here... only death.

               ARWEN shuts her eyes... when she opens them again the VISION 
               is gone... she is staring at DARK TREES once more.

                                     ELF ESCORT (O.S.)
                         Lady Arwen?

               ARWEN turns towards her COMPANION who stares at her, 
               concerned.

                                     ELF ESCORT
                         We cannot delay.

               SUDDENLY: ARWEN wheels ASFALOTH around... riding away.

                                     ELF ESCORT
                              (calling)
                         My Lady!

               EXT. RIVENDELL - DAY

               WIDE SHOT: ARWEN'S HORSE gallops over the BRIDGE and through 
               the GATES into RIVENDELL.

               EXT. ELROND'S BALCONY, RIVENDELL - DAY

               ANGLE ON: ELROND seated alone... ARWEN runs up the STEPS 
               towards him...

                                     ARWEN
                         What did you see?

               CLOSE ON: ELROND stands -- stunned.

                                     ELROND
                         Arwen?

               ANGLE ON: ARWEN breathing hard, walking towards ELROND with 
               a fierce light in her eyes...

                                     ARWEN
                         You have the gift of foresight -- 
                         tell me what you have seen.

               CLOSE ON: ELROND his face grim.

                                     ELROND
                         I looked into your future and I saw 
                         death.

                                     ARWEN
                         There is also life.

               Her father turns away ...

                                     ARWEN
                         You saw there was a child... you saw 
                         my son.

               ELROND stares into space, the fight seems to go out of him.

               He won't look at her...

                                     ELROND
                              (quietly)
                         That future is almost gone.

                                     ARWEN
                         But it is not lost...

                                     ELROND
                         Nothing is certain.

               ANGLE ON: ARWEN gently takes her FATHER'S face in her hands 
               and turns him toward her...

                                     ARWEN
                         Some things are certain. If I leave 
                         him now I will regret it forever.
                              (whisper)
                         Ada, it is time.

               INSERT IMAGE: A HOODED FIGURE ascends a CURVED STAIRCASE 
               towards a GALLERY... The FIGURE stops before a STATUE that 
               holds the BROKEN SHARDS of an ancient sword in its arms.

                                     ARWEN
                         From the ashes of fire shall be woken, 
                         a light from the shadow shall spring, 
                         renewed shall be blade that was 
                         broken...

                         The crownless again shall be King...

               CLOSE ON: The HOODED FIGURE looks up into the sorrowful face 
               of the STATUE... The figure is ARWEN...

                                     ARWEN (V.O.)
                         Reforge the sword.

               INT. ARWEN'S CHAMBER, RIVENDELL - NIGHT

               ANGLE ON: ELROND stares at his daughter, unwavering...

               to the FLOOR...

               CLOSE ON: ELROND picks up her JOURNAL and takes one of her 
               hands in his...

                                     ELROND
                         Your hands are cold.
                              (distressed)
                         The life of the Eldar is leaving 
                         you.

               CLOSE ON: ELROND'S despair is plain...

                                     ELROND
                         It has begun.

                                     ARWEN
                         This was my choice. Ada... Whether 
                         by your will or not, there is no 
                         ship now that can bear me hence.

               ANGLE ON: ELROND, he understands now that to protect his 
               daughter, he must trust her...

               INSERT IMAGES: A BROKEN SWORD GLOWS with RED HEAT... It's

               him...

               ...as SHADOWFAX THUNDERS through the NIGHT.

               EXT. FOOTHILLS OF WHITE MOUNTAINS - DAY

               ANGLE ON: SHADOWFAX powers along the COUNTRYSIDE.

               ANGLE ON: PIPPIN, huddled in front of GANDALF, the WIND 
               sailing through his hair.

                         We have just passed into the realm 
                         of Condor!

               EXT. MINAS TIRITH - DAWN

               ANGLE ON: SHADOWFAX gallops up onto a LOW RIDGE...

               ANGLE ON: Before them is the DARK MASS of Mount Mindolluin, 
               its tall WHITE FACE whitening in the RISING SUN. Upon its 
               outthrust knee is the Guarded City: MINAS TIRITH.

               With SEVEN WALLS OF WHITE STONE, so strong and old that it 
               seems to have been not built, MINAS TIRITH looks carven by 
               giants out of the bones of the earth.

                                     GANDALF
                         Minas Tirith... City of the Kings.

               Suddenly the SUN climbs over the eastern hills, and sends 
               forth a SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT that GLEAMS against the face of 
               the CITY. The TOWER OF ECTHELION stands high within the 
               topmost walls. WHITE BANNERS break and FLUTTER from the 
               BATTLEMENTS in the morning breeze.

               GANDALF steering SHADOWFAX up the STEEP STREETS of MINAS 
               TIRITH.

               ANGLE ON: The stares of frightened GONDORIANS as GANDALF and 
               PIPPIN gallop through the WINDING STREETS...

               AERIAL SHOT: SHADOWFAX, carrying GANDALF and PIPPIN up towards 
               the 7th LEVEL.

               MINAS TIRITH is built in 7 LEVELS -- each behind a CIRCULAR 
               DEFENSIVE WALL. Each level rises -- the city reaches a height 
               of nearly 1000 FEET on its TOPMOST LEVEL.

               A towering BASTION of NATURAL ROCK -- shaped like a sharp 
               ship's prow -- bisects the city from the 2nd LEVEL to the 
               TOP.

               EXT. MINAS TIRITH, COURT OF THE KINGS - DAY

               SHADOWFAX arrives at a GREAT CITADEL on the SUMMIT of the 
               CITY -- 1000 FEET above the PELENNOR FIELDS.

               GANDALF and PIPPIN dismount, leaving the GUARDS of the CITADEL 
               to tend to SHADOWFAX. GANDALF hurries off...

               CLOSE ON: PIPPIN as he takes in his surroundings, his eye 
               caught by a DEAD TREE that stands in the middle of the COURT, 
               FOUR SOLEMN CITADEL GUARDS standing sentry around it.

                                     PIPPIN
                              (whisper)
                         It's the tree.
                              (hurrying after GANDALF)
                         Gandalf! Gandalf!

                                     GANDALF
                         Yes, the white tree of Gondor. The 
                         tree of the King.

               GANDALF leads PIPPIN across a FLAT COURT of WHITE STONES, 
               surrounded by GREEN LAWNS... towards a GREAT HALL beneath 
               THE GLEAMING TOWER.

                                     GANDALF
                         Lord Denethor, however, is not the 
                         King. He is a steward only. A 
                         caretaker of the throne.

               GANDALF lowers his voice, as they approach the TOWER HALL.

                                     GANDALF
                              (quietly)
                         Now, listen carefully. Lord Denethor 
                         is Boromir's father. To give him 
                         news of his beloved son's death would 
                         be most unwise... And do not mention 
                         Frodo... Or the Ring... And say 
                         nothing of Aragorn either.
                              (hesitates)
                         In fact, it's better if you don't 
                         speak at all, Pippin Took.

               CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, suitably chastened, nods.

               INT. MINAS TIRITH TOWER HALL - DAY

               ANGLE ON: A LONG SOLEMN HALL... with ROWS OF BLACK MARBLE 
               PILLARS. Between the pillars stand a silent company of TALL 
               KINGS carved in cold STONE.

               GANDALF strides down the HALL, with PIPPIN following 
               obediently behind.

               At the FAR END, upon a DAIS OF MANY STEPS, sits a LARGE, 
               EMPTY THRONE... and on the wall behind is the IMAGE of a 
               FLOWERING WHITE TREE set in GEMS.

               At the FOOT of the DAIS, in a small STONE CHAIR, sits an OLD 
               MAN, gazing at his lap: DENETHOR -- the Lord Steward of 
               CONDOR.

                                     GANDALF
                         Hail, Denethor, Son of Ecthelion, 
                         Lord and Steward of Gondor.

               DENETHOR does not look up as GANDALF and PIPPIN approach.

                                     GANDALF
                         I come with tidings in this dark 
                         hour -- and with counsel.

               DENETHOR slowly raises COLD EYES...

                                     DENETHOR
                              (bitter)
                         Perhaps you come to explain this?

               DENETHOR holds up BOROMIR'S BROKEN HORN...

                                     DENETHOR
                         Perhaps you come to tell me why my 
                         son is dead?

               CLOSE ON: PIPPIN remembering...

               INSERT IMAGE: BOROMIR, as URUK-HAI arrows thud into his body, 
               he falls to his KNEES...

               PIPPIN starts forward unable to say nothing...

                                     PIPPIN
                         Boromir died to save us... my kinsman 
                         and me... he fell, defending us from 
                         many foes.

               CLOSE ON: DENETHOR pain flickers in his eyes.

                                     GANDALF
                              (hurried whisper)
                         Pippin!

               PIPPIN drops to his knee offering DENETHOR his SWORD...

                                     PIPPIN
                         I offer you my service, such as it 
                         is, in payment of this debt.

               DENETHOR looks at PIPPIN blankly, overcome with grief.

                                     GANDALF
                              (to PIPPIN)
                         Get up!
                              (addressing DENETHOR)
                         My Lord, there will be a time to 
                         grieve for Boromir, but it is not 
                         now. War is coming... the Enemy is 
                         on your doorstep. As Steward, you 
                         are charged with the defence of this 
                         city. Where are Condor's armies?

               DENETHOR gaze turns slowly on GANDALF...

                                     GANDALF
                         You still have friends -- you are 
                         not alone in this fight. Send word 
                         to Theoden of Rohan. Light the 
                         beacons.

               DENETHOR smiles at GANDALF, as if amused by something.

                                     DENETHOR
                              (softly)
                         You think you are wise, Mithrandir, 
                         yet for all your subtleties you have 
                         not wisdom. Do you think the eyes of 
                         the White Tower are blind? I have 
                         seen more than you know. With your 
                         left hand you would use me as a shield 
                         against Mordor and with your right 
                         you would seek to supplant me.

               CLOSE ON: GANDALF looks shocked, DENETHOR'S eyes NARROW.

                                     DENETHOR
                              (contemptuous)
                         I know who rides with Theoden of 
                         Rohan. Oh, yes. Word has reached my 
                         ears of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn, 
                         and I tell you now, I will not bow 
                         to this Ranger from the North -- 
                         last of a ragged house, long bereft 
                         of Lordship.

                                     GANDALF
                              (stung)
                         Authority is not given to you to 
                         deny the return of the King -- 
                         Steward!

                                     DENETHOR
                              (explosive)
                         The rule of Condor is mine, and no 
                         others!

               CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, horrified. GANDALF looks at Denethor closely 
               for a moment, then turns on his heel to leave, PIPPIN follows.

                                     GANDALF
                         Come.

               GANDALF and PIPPIN stride from the TOWER HALL... DENETHOR 
               slumps back into his SEAT.

               INT. MINAS TIRITH, PIPPIN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT

               ANGLE ON: PIPPIN is carefully laying out a SMALL UNIFORM of 
               the ROYAL GUARD on a bed.

                                     PIPPIN
                         So, I imagine this is just a 
                         ceremonial position... I mean, they 
                         don't actually expect me to do any 
                         fighting... do they?

               WIDE: GANDALF STANDING QUIETLY on a BALCONY that overlooks 
               the GREAT CITY.

                                     GANDALF
                         You're in the service of the Steward 
                         now -- you're going to have to do as 
                         you're told, Peregrin Took...
                              (under his breath)
                         Guard of the Citadel!

               EXT. MINAS TIRITH BALCONY - NIGHT

               ANGLE ON: PIPPIN as he stares up at the vast NIGHT SKY.

                                     PIPPIN
                         It's so quiet.

               GANDALF watches the young HOBBIT.

                                     GANDALF
                         It's the deep breath before the 
                         plunge.

                                     PIPPIN
                         I don't want to be in a battle... 
                         but waiting on the edge of one I 
                         can't escape is even worse.
                              (tense)
                         Is there any hope, Gandalf -- for 
                         Frodo and Sam?

               GANDALF joins PIPPIN as they look towards the distant, jagged 
               MOUNTAINS of MORDOR...

                                     GANDALF
                         There never was much hope.

               PIPPIN looks up at him, unnerved. GANDALF gives him a small 
               self-deprecating smile...

                                     GANDALF
                         Just a fool's hope.

               GANDALF and PIPPIN share a quiet moment as they stare out 
               towards the FIERY SKY over MORDOR...

                                     GANDALF (V.O.)
                              (grim)
                         Our enemy is almost ready, his full 
                         strength gathered. Not only Orcs, 
                         but men as well.

                         will answer Mordor' s call.

               ANGLE ON: GANDALF... he is almost talking to himself now... 
               like a man unable to prevent a sure disaster.

                                     GANDALF
                         This will be the end of Gondor as we 
                         know it. Here the hammerstroke will 
                         fall hardest.

                                     GANDALF (V.O.)
                         If the river is taken, if the garrison 
                         at Osgiliath falls, the last defence 
                         of this city will be gone.

               CLOSE ON: PIPPIN... desperately seeking reassurance.

                                     PIPPIN
                         But we have the White Wizard. That's 
                         got to count for something.

               GANDALF looks down at PIPPIN, he says nothing...

                                     PIPPIN
                              (nervous)
                         Gandalf?

               GANDALF stares into the distance as if seeing something in 
               his mind's eye.

                         Mordor's armies in war, the one they 
                         say no living man can kill.

               CLOSE ON: GANDALF still staring intently as if facing his 
               enemy in person.

               ANGLE ON: MINAS MORGUL, a MASSIVE DEAD CITY, set upon a ROCKY 
               KNEE at the HEAD OF THE morgul valley. CORRUPT and LOATHSOME, 
               it glows with a SICKLY LUMINOUS LIGHT -- like a CORPSE CANDLE.

               TWO HUGE, BESTIAL STONE STATUES guard the BRIDGE that leads

               GOLLUM, FRODO and SAM hurry from their COVER scampering in

                         found it.

               FRODO and SAM look AGHAST at the sight of a NARROW, 
               NEARVERTICAL STAIRCASE, cut into the ROCK-FACE... Directly 
               in FRONT of the MINAS MORGUL GATES.

               SUDDENLY! FRODO staggers across the ROAD... as if some FORCE, 
               other than his own will, is at work! He lurches towards the 
               BRIDGE... towards MINAS MORGUL!

               SAM runs after FRODO, catching him in his arms as he STUMBLES.

                                     GOLLUM
                         What's it doing?

                                     SAM
                         No!

               SAM and GOLLUM pull FRODO from the BRIDGE.

                         They're calling me!

               FRODO falls to the GROUND.

               AT THAT MOMENT: the GROUND QUIVERS, and a great RUMBLING 
               NOISE rolls across the ground and ECHOES in the mountains.

               The cold, dull MORGUL VALLEY is suddenly VIOLENT and FIERCE, 
               as UPRUSHING FLAME springs from MOUNT DOOM.

               MINAS MORGUL ANSWERS: A FLARE of LIVID LIGHTNING, FORKS of 
               BLUE FLAME, SPRING UP from the TOWER into the SULLEN CLOUD.

                                                             INTERCUT WITH:

               EXT. MINAS TIRITH BALCONY - NIGHT

               ANGLE ON: VIOLENT FIERY FLASHES light the CLOUD above 
               MORDOR... SHARP THUNDER rolls across 40 MILES to MINAS TIRITH.

               CLOSE ON: PIPPIN looking on in FRIGHTENED AWE. GANDALF'S 
               comforting HAND rests on his shoulder.

                                                             INTERCUT WITH:

               EXT. MINAS MORGUL - NIGHT

               SAM and GOLLUM lead FRODO to the STAIRS...

               ABOVE MINAS MORGUL the SKY is BRIGHT with LIGHT as the CITY, 
               erupts...

                                     GOLLUM
                         Hide! Hide!

                                                             INTERCUT WITH:

               EXT. MINAS TIRITH BATTLEMENTS - NIGHT

               ANGLES ON: FACES of SOLDIERS and CIVILIANS of MINAS TIRITH 
               as they watch from the PARAPETS of the CITY.

                                                             INTERCUT WITH:

               EXT. MINAS MORGUL - NIGHT

               FRODO and SAM sink to the ground, holding their hands against 
               their ears, as out of the CITY comes a RENDING SCREECH...

               SHIVERING, rising swiftly to a PIERCING PITCH beyond the 
               range of hearing. The terrible CRY ends, falling back through 
               a long sickening WAIL, to SILENCE.

               ANGLE ON: FRODO slowly RAISES HIS HEAD... across the NARROW 
               VALLEY, directly opposite the HOBBITS, the LORD OF THE NAZGUL --
               the WITCH KING -- suddenly RISES UP out of the DEAD CITY on 
               his FELL-BEAST!

               ...as the WITCH KING settles on the BATTLEMENTS of MINAS 
               MORGUL. His DARK HEAD turns this way and that, sweeping the 
               shadows with unseen eyes -- as if SENSING the RING!

               ANGLE ON: FRODO breaking out into a COLD SWEAT. He squeezes 
               his eyes shut, clutching at his SHIRT as if it's on FIRE!

                                     FRODO
                              (gasping)
                         I can feel his blade!

               THE CAVERNOUS GATE of MINAS MORGUL swings OPEN...

               ...and a HUGE ARMY MARCHES OUT!

               RANK upon RANK of ARMOUR CLAD ORCS, moving SWIFTLY and 
               SILENTLY, pass close to FRODO and SAM in an ENDLESS STREAM 
               of RAGGED COLUMNS!

               EXT. MINAS TIRITH BALCONY - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON: GANDALF...

                                     GANDALF
                              (quiet)
                         We come to it at last... the great 
                         battle of our time.

                                                             INTERCUT WITH:

               EXT. MINAS MORGUL - NIGHT

               ANGLE ON: 75,000 ORCS MARCHING TO WAR, just below FRODO and 
               SAM.

                                     GANDALF (V.O.)
                         This war is long planned. Sauron has 
                         hated the west through many ages... 
                         It is a hatred that flows from the 
                         depths of time, across the deeps of 
                         the Sea.

               The WITCH KING SWOOPS down the VALLEY to join the HEAD of 
               his ARMY. He vanishes into the GLOOM -- a shadow into shadow.

               CLOSE ON: GOLLUM peers out from his stony hiding place.

                                     GOLLUM
                              (urgent)
                         Come, hobbits. We climb -- we must 
                         climb!

               ANGLE ON: FRODO, SAM and GOLLUM climb the STONY STAIRS high 
               above the MARCHING ARMY.

               EXT. MINAS TIRITH BALCONY - NIGHT

               ANGLE ON: GANDALF... thinking, calculating...

                                     GANDALF
                              (to himself)
                         The board is set, the pieces are 
                         moving.

               EXT. MINAS TIRITH SIXTH LEVEL - NIGHT

               ANGLE ON: GANDALF striding BACK STREETS of the CITY... so 
               DETERMINED and PURPOSEFUL is he, that PIPPIN has to RUN to 
               keep up. GANDALF suddenly stops and looks down at PIPPIN...

                                     GANDALF
                         Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a 
                         task to be done. Another opportunity 
                         for one of the Shire-folk to prove 
                         their great worth!

               GANDALF kneels down and looks at PIPPIN earnestly, his hand 
               on PIPPIN'S shoulder.

                                     GANDALF
                         You must not fail me.

               GANDALF watches as PIPPIN hurries away.

               EXT. WEST OSGILIATH, RIVER ANDUIN - NIGHT

               WIDE ON: An ANCIENT STONE BRIDGE which spans the RUINS of 
               EAST and WEST OSGILIATH -- a once MIGHTY GONDORIAN CITY.

               WIDE ON: ITHILIEN RANGERS patrolling the BRIDGE and the 
               RIVERBANK.

               WEST OSGILIATH has fallen into disrepair, but the DESOLATION 
               of EAST OSGILIATH is more pronounced -- it is held by the 
               FORCES of MORDOR.

               CAMERA tracks down beneath the BRIDGE to the DARK WATERS... 
               catching a STEALTHY MOVEMENT...

               ANGLE ON: MANY BOATS, carrying MURDEROUS-LOOKING ORCS, are 
               quietly tracking down the RIVER. On board several HUNCHED 
               FIGURES steer with LONG OARS.

                                     GOTHMOG
                              (to his oarsmen)
                         Quiet!

               EXT. WEST OSGILIATH, RIVER ANDUIN - NIGHT

               CLOSE ON: FARAMIR, CAPTAIN OF CONDOR, as he issues orders to 
               his SOLDIERS.

                                     FARAMIR
                              (urgent)
                         To the river -- quick!

               ANGLE ON: ITHILIEN RANGERS take position; they are all 
               WEATHERED, HARDENED, PROFESSIONAL SOLDIERS... Watchful, ready, 
               waiting...

                                     GOTHMOG
                         Faster!

               ON THE RIVER the BOATS quietly advance.

                                     ORC COMMANDER
                         Draw swords!

               ANGLE ON: FARAMIR and his SOLDIERS lie in wait. As the BOATS 
               arrive HUNDREDS of ORCS race ashore. FARAMIR steps out, his 
               SWORD drawn. A FIERCE BATTLE ensues, but FARAMIR is unable 
               to stop the advance as HUNDREDS OF ORCS cross the WIDE BRIDGE 
               into WEST OSGILIATH.

               EXT. MOUNT MINDOLLUIN - DAWN

               HIGH ANGLE ON: A DIZZYING VIEW... Looking down on MINAS 
               TIRITH, 1000 FEET BELOW, as PIPPIN desperately scrambles up 
               the ROCKY MOUNTAINSIDE.

               EXT. MINAS TIRITH BEACON - DAWN

               PIPPIN clambers over a ROCKY LEDGE and ducks behind a STONE 
               WALL... panting HEAVILY.

               ANGLE ON: An ancient STONE LEDGE holds a GREAT PILE of 
               FIREWOOD, secured in stacked bundles... The MINAS TIRITH 
               BEACON!

               TWO bored CITADEL GUARDS sit chatting... passing the long 
               hours.

                                                             INTERCUT WITH:

               EXT. MINAS TIRITH BEACON - DAWN

               ANGLES ON: PIPPIN as he stealthily manages to POUR OIL on 
               the WOOD and set a FLAME to it!

               Within SECONDS, the GREAT PYRE is alight! The GUARDS look on 
               in TOTAL SURPRISE as the FLAMES ERUPT into the TWILIGHT SKY.

                                                             INTERCUT WITH:

               EXT. MINAS TIRITH STREETS

               ANGLE ON: GANDALF as the BEACONS burst into FLAMES... His 
               eyes flash briefly with TRIUMPH before he hurries off...

               EXT. MINAS TIRITH BATTLEMENTS - DUSK

               ANGLE ON: The BEACON glows BRIGHTLY on the slopes of MOUNT 
               MINDOLLUIN, high above MINAS TIRITH...

               PULL BACK: GANDALF hurries to the BATTLEMENT, looking further 
               west along the WHITE MOUNTAINS.

                                     GANDALF
                              (to himself)
                         Amon Din... come on...

               ANGLE ON: a bright FIRE ignites on a DISTANT MOUNTAIN PEAK.

               NOISY COMMOTION in the city as PEOPLE realise the BEACONS 
               have been lit!

                                     SOLDIER
                              (yelling)
                         The beacon! The beacon at Amon Din 
                         is lit!

               FLASH INSERT: DENETHOR staring at the BEACON from the CITADEL 
               WINDOW... a look of BLACK FURY on his face.

               ANGLE ON: GANDALF, a strange smile plays on his face...

                                     GANDALF
                              (to himself)
                         Hope is kindled.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. WHITE MOUNTAINS AERIAL - NIGHT

               AERIAL SHOT: MOVING over the WHITE MOUNTAINS... as the TRAIL 
               of GREAT FIRES slowly winds from PEAK TO PEAK.

               EXT. EDORAS COURTYARD - DAWN

               ANGLE ON: A ROCKY PEAK high above EDORAS... a GREAT BEACON 
               FIRE is IGNITED.

               ON THE SOUNDTRACK: A BELL TOLLS urgently!

               CLOSE ON: ARAGORN looks tensely out across the MOUNTAINS...

               PULL BACK: ARAGORN runs towards the GOLDEN HALL.

               INT. EDORAS, GOLDEN HALL - DAWN

               CLOSE ON: ARAGORN bursts into the GOLDEN HALL.

                                     ARAGORN
                         The beacons of Minas Tirith! The 
                         beacons are lit! Condor calls for 
                         aid!

               ANGLE ON: THEODEN looks up startled.

               CLOSE ON: EOWYN, EOMER turn to look at their UNCLE... tension 
               builds.

               CLOSE ON: THEODEN his head lowered... Slowly it rises -- he 
               looks ARAGORN in the EYE.

                                     THEODEN
                         Then Rohan will answer. Muster the 
                         Rohirrim!

               EXT. EDORAS COURTYARD - DAWN

               WIDE ON: EDORAS LOOKOUT... A SOLDIER RINGING the GREAT BELL 
               in alarm as below, in the COURTYARD, SOLDIERS mount their 
               STEEDS amid great activity.

               ANGLE ON: THEODEN striding purposefully outside, flanked by 
               EOMER and his SOLDIERS...

                                     THEODEN
                         Assemble the army at Dunharrow -- as 
                         many men as can be found. You have 
                         two days... On the third, we ride 
                         for Condor... and war!

               ANGLE ON: THEODEN strides onto the PARAPETS...

                                     THEODEN
                         Gamling, make haste across the 
                         Riddermark... Summon every able-bodied 
                         man to Dunharrow!

               ANGLE ON: THEODEN watches as below the SOLDIERS prepare.

               ANGLE ON: EOWYN hurriedly pulling on RIDING GLOVES, preparing 
               to mount her HORSE.

                                     ARAGORN
                         You ride with us?

               EOWYN turns and runs SMACK into ARAGORN...

                                     EOWYN
                         Just to the encampment. It's tradition 
                         for the women of the Court to farewell 
                         the men.

               ARAGORN smiles... reaching past her, he lifts a cover to 
               reveal a SWORD, strapped to the side of the saddle of her 
               HORSE.

               EOWYN deftly pulls the cover back down. She looks at ARAGORN.

                                     EOWYN
                              (softly)
                         The Men have found their Captain -- 
                         they will follow you into battle, 
                         even to death.
                              (quietly)
                         You have given us hope.

               PULL BACK: to reveal THEODEN stares around at the STREETS 
               and PEOPLE of EDORAS... it is as if he knows he will not see 
               this place again.

                                     THEODEN (V.O.)
                         So... It is before the walls of Minas 
                         Tirith that the doom of our time 
                         will be decided.

               ANGLE ON: EOMER astride his horse, calls to the assembled 
               SOLDIERS...

                                     EOMER
                         Now is the hour! Riders of Rohan -- 
                         oaths you have taken. Now, fulfil 
                         them all -- to Lord and land!

               EXT. PLAINS OF ROHAN - DAY

               ANGLE ON: THEODEN astride SNOWMANE, as he, EOMER, ARAGORN & 
               MERRY and LEGOLAS & GIMLI ride out AMID a GREAT COLUMN of 
               ROHIRRIM, THUNDERING towards DUNHARROW in the MOUNTAINS.

               ANGLE ON: FARAMIR and his MEN are fighting a losing BATTLE 
               against the MORDOR invasion.

                                     MADRIL
                         We can't hold them. The city is lost!

                                     FARAMIR
                         Tell the men to break up. We ride 
                         for Minas Tirith.

               ON THE SOUNDTRACK: OMINOUS SOUNDS of WIND RISING... HUGE 
               WINGS BEATING...

                                     RANGER
                         Nazgul!

               SPINNING ANGLE: FARAMIR looks up at the SKY... ITHILIEN 
               RANGERS are suddenly nervous, frightened... A HUGE SHADOW 
               passes overhead!

                                     FARAMIR
                         Take cover!

               A SUDDEN TERRIFYING SHRIEK rends the AIR!

                                     FARAMIR
                         Pull back! Pull back to Minas Tirith!

               ANGLE ON: SOLDIERS RETREATING through the RUINS of the CITY 
               as, high in the sky above, the NAZGUL swoop...

               ANGLE ON: MADRIL as he is cut down by an ORC...

               CLOSE ON: MADRIL... his breathing quick and shallow... 
               footsteps approach...

               ANGLE ON: The HIDEOUSLY deformed features of GOTHMOG standing 
               over the prone figure of the INJURED RANGER.

               Grabbing a spear from a nearby underling, GOTHMOG drives the 
               shaft into MADRIL'S chest...

               CLOSE ON: GOTHMOG surveys the carnage with satisfaction.

                                     GOTHMOG
                         The age of men is over. The time of 
                         the Orc has come.

               EXT. PELENNOR FIELDS - DAY

               FARAMIR and a few survivors flee WEST OSGILIATH, desperately 
               riding toward MINAS TIRITH... in the SKY above DARK SHAPES 
               pursue them...

               ANGLE ON: SUDDENLY, from on HIGH, the NAZGUL strike!

               TILT DOWN: following the NAZGUL as it SWOOPS out of LOWLYING, 
               MURKY CLOUDS tossing MEN in the AIR like LIMP RAG-DOLLS!

               AT THAT MOMENT: Across the PLAIN, a FIGURE clothed in WHITE 
               rides towards them!

               From the BATTLEMENTS of MINAS TIRITH, a call... "The White 
               Rider!"

               EXT. PELENNOR FIELDS - DAY

               WIDE ON: GANDALF as he spurs SHADOWFAX forward! PIPPIN clings 
               tightly to the great horses MANE.

               ANGLE ON: FARAMIR, SWORD in hand, remains at the REAR, trying 
               desperately to fend off the DEADLY ASSAULT...

               AGAIN the FELL-BEASTS DIVE low...

               GANDALF thunders into view, raising his STAFF...

               A SHAFT OF WHITE LIGHT suddenly stabs upwards! The NAZGUL 
               SWERVES AWAY from the LIGHT, as it pierces the LOW CLOUD!

               For a BRIEF MOMENT, SUNLIGHT streams through the hole onto 
               PELENNOR FIELDS... The NAZGUL circle away from the SUN RAYS, 
               swiftly spiralling higher and higher.

               The NAZGUL defeated, GANDALF and the RANGERS ride towards 
               the safety of MINAS TIRITH.

               EXT. MINAS TIRITH GATES - DAY

               ANGLE ON: IORLAS runs towards the GATES, yelling...

                                     IORLAS
                         Open the Gates! Pull!

               The GREAT GATES OPEN, allowing GANDALF, PIPPIN, FARAMIR and 
               the OSGILIATH SURVIVORS to RIDE IN... Nearly 100 WOUNDED AND 
               SHOCKED MEN.

               AS GANDALF pulls SHADOWFAX up...

                                     FARAMIR
                         Mithrandir!

               ANGLE ON: FARAMIR STEERS HIS HORSE through the CROWD towards 
               GANDALF...

                                     FARAMIR
                         They broke through our defences. 
                         They have taken the bridge and the 
                         West Bank. Battalions of Orcs are 
                         crossing the River.

                                     IORLAS
                         It is as the Lord Denethor predicted -- 
                         long has he foreseen this doom!

                                     GANDALF
                         Foreseen and done nothing!

               FARAMIR suddenly STARES at PIPPIN. GANDALF reads the surprise 
               in his eyes.

                                     GANDALF
                         Faramir?... This is not the first 
                         halfling to have crossed your path...

               FARAMIR shakes his head.

                                     FARAMIR
                         No.

                                     PIPPIN
                              (disbelief)
                         You've seen Frodo and Sam?

               FARAMIR NODS.

                                     GANDALF
                         Where? When?

                                     FARAMIR
                         In Ithilien, not two days ago. Gandalf -- 
                         they are taking the road to the Morgul 
                         Vale.

                                     GANDALF
                              (shocked realisation)
                         ...And then the Pass of Cirith Ungol.

               CLOSE ON: GANDALF, deeply troubled.

                                     PIPPIN
                         What does that mean? What's wrong?

                                     GANDALF
                              (urgent)
                         Faramir... Tell me everything.

               EXT. CIRITH UNGOL STAIRS - NIGHT

               ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM following GOLLUM up the dizzying 
               STAIRWAY, carved into the SHEER CLIFF.

               The STEPS are NARROW, UNEVENLY SPACED, and many are BROKEN.

               They are so STEEP that FRODO and SAM climb as if on a LADDER -- 
               their desperate FINGERS clinging to the STEPS ABOVE -- trying 
               not to look at the LONG BLACK FALL below them.

               ANGLE ON: FRODO'S foot slips and for a brief moment he is 
               HANGING PRECARIOUSLY from the ROCK-FACE.

                                     GOLLUM
                         Careful, Master -- careful! Very far 
                         to fall. Very dangerous on the stairs.

               EXT. CIRITH UNGOL LEDGE - NIGHT

               ANGLE ON: GOLLUM peering down from ABOVE... he has reached a 
               SMALL LEDGE.

                                     GOLLUM
                         Come, Master.

               CLOSE ON: FRODO tries to CLAMBER UP onto the LEDGE... as he 
               does, the RING slips out of his SHIRT and DANGLES in FULL 
               VIEW of GOLLUM!

               CLOSE ON: GOLLUM rears back in shock... tenses like a CAT, 
               EYES WIDENING.

                                     GOLLUM
                              (dreamlike)
                         Come to Smeagol.

               ANGLE ON: FRODO, head bowed, trying to pull himself up. He 
               doesn't notice GOLLUM'S HAND reaching for the RING!

               CLOSE ON: GOLLUM'S FINGERS... closing in on the RING...

               ANGLE ON: SAM, still TEETERING on the PRECIPITOUS STAIRS 
               DRAWS HIS SWORD!

                                     SAM
                              (alarmed yell)
                         Mr. Frodo!

               STARTLED, FRODO looks down at SAM, losing his footing in the 
               process...

                                     SAM
                         Get back, you. Don't touch him!

               ANGLE ON: SAM'S horrified face as...

               GOLLUM'S out-stretched HAND suddenly GRASPS FRODO'S ARM 
               pulling him SAFELY onto the LEDGE.

               GOLLUM glares down at SAM.

                                     GOLLUM
                         Why does he hates poor Smeagol? What 
                         has Smeagol ever done to him? Master?

               CLOSE ON: GOLLUM blinks, masking the MALICE of his EYES with 
               their heavy pale lids.

                                     GOLLUM
                         Master carries heavy burden... Smeagol 
                         knows... Heavy, heavy burden. Fat 
                         one cannot know. Smeagol look after 
                         Master.

               CLOSE ON: GOLLUM creeps CLOSE to FRODO and WHISPERS in his 
               ear:

                                     GOLLUM
                              (rasping whisper)
                         He wants it -- he needs it. Smeagol 
                         sees it in his eye. Very soon he 
                         will ask you for it -- you will see... 
                         the Fat One will take it from you.

               CLOSE ON: FRODO looking at SAM... his hand strays to his 
               NECK, closing tight around the RING.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. OSGILIATH - DAY

               HIGH ABOVE OSGILIATH, the SINISTER PROFILE of the WITCH KING 
               seated on a FELL BEAST as GOTHMOG stands, awaiting his orders.

                                     WITCH KING
                              (clinical)
                         Send forth all legions. Do not stop 
                         the attack until the city is taken. 
                         Slay them all.

                                     GOTHMOG
                         What of the Wizard?

               SLOWLY the WITCH KING'S HEAD turns...

                                     WITCH KING
                         I shall break him.

               EXT. MINAS TIRITH BATTLEMENTS - DAY

               REACTIONS: OF GONDORIAN SOLDIERS upon the MINAS TIRITH 
               BATTLEMENTS... AWE... FEAR... TERROR!

               ANXIOUS SOLDIERS crowd around GANDALF.

                                     SOLDIER 1
                              (worried)
                         Where are Theoden's riders?

                                     SOLDIER 2
                         Will Rohan's army come?

                                     SOLDIER 1
                         Mithrandir?

                                     GANDALF
                              (grim)
                         Courage is the best defence that you 
                         have now.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MINAS TIRITH TOWER HALL - DAY

               CLOSE ON: PIPPIN... DRESSED in OVER-SIZED ARMOUR... kneels 
               before DENETHOR...

                                     PIPPIN
                              (nervous)
                         Here do I swear fealty and service 
                         to Gondor, in peace or war, in living 
                         or dying, from this hour henceforth, 
                         until my lord release me, or death 
                         take me.

                                     DENETHOR
                         And I shall not forget it, nor fail 
                         to reward that which is given...

               ANGLE ON: DENETHOR proffers his RING which PIPPIN kisses...

                                     DENETHOR
                         ...fealty with love...

               DENETHOR gently raises PIPPIN'S head... DENETHOR'S eyes meet 
               FARAMIR'S.

                                     DENETHOR
                         ...valour with honour...

               DENETHOR crosses to a table... Attendants BEGIN SERVING him 
               a MEAL...

                                     DENETHOR
                         ...disloyalty with vengeance.

               DENETHOR addresses his meal...

                                     DENETHOR
                              (reasonable)
                         I do not think we should so lightly 
                         abandon the outer defences; defences 
                         that your brother long held intact.

                                     FARAMIR
                         What would you have me do?

                                     DENETHOR
                         I will not yield the River and 
                         Pelennor unfought -- Osgiliath must 
                         be retaken.

                                     FARAMIR
                         My Lord, Osgiliath is overrun.

                                     DENETHOR
                         Much must be risked in war. Is there 
                         a Captain here who still has the 
                         courage to do his Lord's will?

               CLOSE ON: FARAMIR as he finally realises the truth.

                                     FARAMIR
                              (quietly)
                         You wish now that our places had 
                         been exchanged, that I had died and 
                         Boromir had lived?

               CLOSE ON: For a brief second, DENETHOR seems to hesitate, 
               then...

                                     DENETHOR
                              (coldly)
                         Yes, I wish that.

                                     FARAMIR
                         Since you are robbed of Boromir, I 
                         will do what I can in his stead.

               ANGLE ON: FARAMIR bows low to DENETHOR, then turns to leave, 
               stops, turns back...

                                     FARAMIR
                         If I should return... think better 
                         of me, father.

                                     DENETHOR
                         That will depend on the manner of 
                         your return.

               DENETHOR continues with his meal. FARAMIR exits.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CIRITH UNGOL LEDGE - DAWN

               AERIAL SHOT: HIGH above MINAS MORGUL, on the SMALL LEDGE 
               next to the STAIRS, LIE the FIGURES of FRODO, SAM and GOLLUM.

               SAM watches a sleeping GOLLUM suspiciously as he desperately 
               tries to stay awake. SLOWLY, INEVITABLY, SAM, falls asleep.

               CLOSE ON: GOLLUM'S EYES SNAP OPEN... he sits up and quietly 
               crawls towards SAM'S KNAPSACK.

               SAM breathes deeply now, heavily asleep.

               GOLLUM grimaces in DISTASTE as he pulls out the LEMBAS 
               BREAD... Quietly he SPRINKLES CRUMBS over the sleeping SAM.

               ANGLE ON: GOLLUM as he throws the remaining LEMBAS BREAD 
               over the cliff.

               CLOSE ON: SAM'S EYES flick open... GOLLUM spins around, caught 
               off guard...

                                     SAM
                         What are you up to? Sneaking off, 
                         are we?

                                     SMEAGOL
                              (prevaricating)
                         Sneaking? Sneaking? Fat Hobbit is 
                         always so polite. Smeagol shows them 
                         secret ways that nobody else could 
                         find and they say "Sneak!", "Sneak!" 
                         Very nice friends, oh yes, my 
                         Precious, very nice.

                                     SAM
                         Alright, alright -- you just startled 
                         me is all.
                              (peering over the 
                              cliff's edge)
                         What were you doing?

                                     SMEAGOL
                              (sly)
                         Sneaking!

               Too exhausted to argue, SAM turns away.

                                     SAM
                         Fine, have it your own way.

               SAM gently shakes FRODO'S shoulder.

                                     SAM
                         Sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo. We 
                         have to be moving on.

               SAM rummages through his KNAPSACK, looking for a bite to 
               eat.

               FRODO sits up slowly.

                                     FRODO
                         It's dark still.

                                     SAM
                         It's always dark here --

               CLOSE ON: SAM stops rummaging... SHOCK on his face.

                                     SAM
                         It's gone... the Elven bread!

                                     FRODO
                              (alarmed)
                         What? That's all we have left!

               SAM slowly turns to GOLLUM...

                                     SAM
                              (dawning realisation)
                         He took it! He must have!

                                     GOLLUM
                              (shocked)
                         Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol. 
                         Smeagol hates nasty Elf bread!

                                     SAM
                         You're a lying wretch! What did you 
                         do with it?

                                     FRODO
                         He doesn't eat it... he can't have 
                         taken it.

               CLOSE ON: GOLLUM slaps his hand against SAM'S JACKET... 
               sending LEMBAS CRUMBS RAINING DOWN!

                                     GOLLUM
                         What's this? Crumbs on his jacketses!
                              (fake outrage)
                         He took it! He took it! I seen him, 
                         he's always stuffing himself when 
                         Master's not looking!

                                     SAM
                              (angry)
                         That's a filthy lie!

               SAM is ENRAGED... he throws himself at GOLLUM... punching 
               him!

                                     SAM
                              (yelling)
                         You stinking two-faced sneak! Call 
                         me a thief...

                                     FRODO
                              (yelling)
                         Sam! Stop it!

               FRODO pulls SAM off GOLLUM...

                                     SAM
                              (yelling)
                         I'll kill him! I'll kill him!

                                     FRODO
                         No, Sam!

               FRODO COLLAPSES on the GROUND!

               CLOSE ON: SAM'S horrified face!

                                     SAM
                         Alight, I'm sorry, I didn't mean for 
                         it to go so far, I was so angry... 
                         Here, let's rest up a bit.

               SAM attempts to fuss around FRODO...

                                     FRODO
                              (exhausted)
                         I'm alright.

                                     SAM
                         No, no, you're not alright! You're 
                         exhausted! It's that Gollum; it's 
                         this place; it's that thing around 
                         your neck. I could help a bit... I 
                         could carry it for a while -- share 
                         the load.

               CLOSE ON: A terrible light comes into FRODO'S eyes as he 
               STARES into the EARNEST eyes of SAM.

                                     FRODO
                         Get away!

               FRODO pushes SAM away, clutching at the RING beneath his 
               shirt

                                     SAM
                              (confused)
                         I don't want to keep it... I just 
                         want to help!

               FRODO rises to his FEET, as if empowered with a frightening 
               intense ENERGY.

                                     GOLLUM
                         See! See! He wants it for himself.

                                     SAM
                              (beside himself)
                         Shut up, you! Go away. Get out of 
                         here.

               CLOSE ON: FRODO...

                                     FRODO
                              (quietly)
                         No, Sam... it's you.

               SAM stares at FRODO with DISBELIEF.

                                     FRODO
                         I'm sorry, Sam...

               CLOSE ON: TEARS WELL in SAM'S eyes...

                                     SAM
                              (hopelessly)
                         But... he's a liar... he's poisoned 
                         you against me.

                                     FRODO
                         You can't help me anymore.

                                     SAM
                         You don't mean that.

                                     FRODO
                              (eerie calm)
                         Go home.

               CLOSE ON: TEARS spill down SAM'S cheeks... as FRODO TURNS 
               AWAY!

               ANGLE ON: FRODO and GOLLUM leave... SAM is in complete MISERY.

               EXT. MINAS TIRITH STREETS - DAY

               ANGLE ON: FARAMIR leading a COLUMN of 200 KNIGHTS through 
               the STREETS towards the CITY GATE... PEOPLE are rushing 
               forward, THROWING FLOWERS over the KNIGHTS.

               CLOSE ON: GANDALF hurries alongside FARAMIR'S HORSE.

                                     GANDALF
                         Faramir! Your father's will has turned 
                         to madness! Do not throw away your 
                         life so rashly!

                                     FARAMIR
                              (deadened)
                         Where does my allegiance lie if not 
                         here?

               GANDALF reads the PAIN in FARAMIR'S eyes... he calls after 
               him, trying one more time to stop the YOUNG MAN.

                                     GANDALF
                         Your father loves you, Faramir!
                              (quietly)
                         And will remember it before the end.

               EXT. MINAS TIRITH BATTLEMENTS - DAY

               HIGH ANGLE: FARAMIR leads the 200 MOUNTED KNIGHTS through 
               the GATES OF MINAS TIRITH and across the PELENNOR FIELDS 
               towards the RUINS of OSGILIATH.

               ANGLE ON: The people of MINAS TIRITH watch from the 
               BATTLEMENTS.

               HIGH WIDE: FARAMIR'S KNIGHTS FAN OUT... to form one straight 
               line of 200 HORSEMEN.

               EXT. WEST OSGILIATH - DAY

               GOTHMOG and his MEN watch as the KNIGHTS approach.

               INT. TOWER HALL, MINAS TIRITH - DAY

               FAST PUSH IN... to PIPPIN looking on as DENETHOR eats.

                                     DENETHOR
                         Can you sing, Master Hobbit?

                                     PIPPIN
                              (uneasy)
                         Well... yes, at least, well enough 
                         for my own people... but we have no 
                         songs for great halls and evil 
                         times... we seldom sing of anything 
                         more terrible than wind or rain.

                                     DENETHOR
                         And why should your songs be unfit 
                         for my halls, or for hours such as 
                         these. Come -- sing me a song!

               PIPPIN'S simple, clear voice echoes through the VAST HALL.

                                     PIPPIN (V.O.)
                         Home is behind, the world ahead, And 
                         there are many paths to tread. Through 
                         shadow to the edge of night Until 
                         the stars are all alight. Mist and 
                         shadow, cloud and shade: All shall 
                         fade, all shall fade.

                                                             INTERCUT WITH:

               EXT. PELENNOR FIELDS/OSGILIATH RUINS - DAY

               ANGLE ON: SLOW MOTION... TRACKING WITH THE 200 MOUNTED 
               KNIGHTS.

               ANGLE ON: SLOW MOTION... GOTHMOG rises amidst the RUINS of 
               OSGILIATH.

               ANGLE ON: SLOW MOTION... FARAMIR'S KNIGHTS -- 75 yards away -- 
               thundering towards camera.

               PULL BACK... to GOTHMOG... he turns to CAMERA and RAISES HIS 
               BOW.

               ANGLE ON: SLOW MOTION... Behind GOTHMOG -- all over the RUINED 
               CITY -- 5000 ORC ARCHERS rise to their feet... BLACK ARROWS 
               already strung on their BOWS!

               CLOSE ON: SLOW MOTION... FARAMIR YELLING defiantly.

               WIDE PROFILE: SLOW MOTION... FARAMIR'S 200 KNIGHTS ride 
               straight into a BLACK WALL of FLYING ARROWS...

               AS ONE, the HORSES and HORSEMEN collapse into a CARTWHEELING, 
               TUMBLING HEAP... within seconds all are MOTIONLESS.

               CLOSE ON: NORMAL SPEED... FAST CUTS of SCREAMING ORCS...

               INT. TOWER HALL, MINAS TIRITH - DAY

               THROUGHOUT the above sequence DENETHOR has continued to EAT.

               ANGLE ON: PIPPIN finishes his bittersweet song... he looks 
               up at DENETHOR who continues as if he has not sent his son 
               to his death.

               ANGLE ON: PIPPIN turns away, his SORROW etched on his YOUNG 
               FACE...

               EXT. MINAS TIRITH COURTYARD - DAY

               GANDALF sits quietly in a COURTYARD, alone, defeated.

               EXT. OSGILIATH BRIDGE - DAY

               GREAT SIEGE TOWERS and CATAPULTS are ROLL along the REPARIED 
               BRIDGE which spans both sides of OSGILIATH... They head 
               straight towards MINAS TIRITH...

               EX. DUNHARROW ENCAMPMENT - DUSK

               ANGLES ON: ARAGORN, THEODEN, EOMER, MERRY, LEGOLAS and GIMLI 
               GALLOP into a VAST CAMP beneath the COVER OF TREES...

               TEEMING with MEN, HORSES and TENTS.

               ANGLE ON: THEODEN acknowledges GRIMBOLD, a MARSHALL OF ROHAN, 
               as he passes by a GROUP of SOLDIERS.

                                     THEODEN
                         Grimbold, how many?

                                     GRIMBOLD
                         I bring five hundred men from the 
                         Westfold, my Lord.

                                     ROHAN MARSHALL (O.S.)
                         We have three hundred more from 
                         Fenmarch, Theoden, King.

               THEODEN smiles grimly as he rides on.

                                     DENETHOR
                              (quietly)
                         Where are the riders from Snowbourne?

                                     GAMLING (O.S.)
                         None have come, My Lord.

               EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - DUSK

               ARAGORN joins THEODEN on a BLUFF overlooking the ENCAMPMENT 
               BELOW...

               CAMERA CRANES to REVEAL: THOUSANDS of MEN and HORSES! Smoke 
               from many small CAMP-FIRES has filled the VALLEY with a 
               TWILIGHT HAZE.

                                     THEODEN
                              (quietly)
                         Six thousand spears... less than 
                         half of what I had hoped for...

               ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns to THEODEN...

                                     ARAGORN
                         Six thousand will not be enough to 
                         break the lines of Mordor.

                                     THEODEN
                         More will come.

                                     ARAGORN
                         Every hour lost hastens Condor's 
                         defeat. We have till dawn. Then we 
                         must ride.

               CLOSE ON: THEODEN realising what ARAGORN is saying -- no 
               matter the numbers he must commit to war by the morning.

               THEODEN nods.

               The HORSES whinny loudly in the distance... THEODEN looks up 
               at the MOUNTAIN which looms behind them...

               EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - DUSK

               ANGLE ON: HORSES rearing in terror as ROHAN SOLDIERS try to 
               quieten them...

               ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS and GIMLI move through the CAMP...

               CLOSE ON: LEGOLAS looking at a group of ROHAN SOLDIERS... 
               they sit quiet and hunched... no-one speaking...

               LEGOLAS looking toward EOMER who is unsaddling his HORSE...

                                     LEGOLAS
                              (uneasy)
                         The horses are restless... And the 
                         men are quiet?

                                     EOMER
                         They grow nervous in the shadow of 
                         the mountain...

               GIMLI'S eyes travel to a ROW of ANCIENT STANDING STONES that 
               mark the ENTRANCE to a ROAD leading away from the ENCAMPMENT 
               and INTO the MOUNTAIN.

                                     GIMLI
                         That road there -- where does that 
                         lead?

                                     LEGOLAS
                         It is the road to the Dimholt... The 
                         door under the mountain.

                                     EOMER
                         None who venture there ever return.
                              (under his breath)
                         That mountain is evil...

               ANGLE ON: ARAGORN stands before the road as though 
               transfixed... before him a HORSE whinnies and pulls at his 
               ropes nervously...

               ARAGORN POV: A GHOSTLY FIGURE seems to emerge from the 
               gloom... ARAGORN starts in fright as...

                                     GIMLI (O.S.)
                         Aragorn!

               ANGLE ON: ARAGORN stares down at the LITTLE DWARF...

                                     GIMLI
                         Let's find some food.

               ARAGORN casts another look back at the ANCIENT STANDING STONES 
               before following GIMLI.

               EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - DUSK

               ANGLE ON: All is quiet in the ENCAMPMENT...

               INT. EOWYN'S TENT, DUNHARROW - NIGHT

               ANGLE ON: EOWYN kneels before MERRY, adjusting his HELMET 
               STRAP.

                                     EOWYN
                         There! A true Esquire of Rohan.

               MERRY exhales -- excited and terrified in equal measure. In 
               his EXCITEMENT, he draws his SWORD...

               EOWYN steps back, laughing...

                                     MERRY
                         Sorry. It isn't all that dangerous.
                              (despondent)
                         It isn't even sharp.

                                     EOWYN
                         Well, that's no good. You won't kill 
                         many Orcs with a blunt blade. Come 
                         on.

               EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - NIGHT

               As EOWYN and MERRY leave the tent, EOMER and GAMLING are 
               sitting nearby, finishing a meal... EOWYN ushers MERRY off.

                                     EOWYN
                         To the Smithy -- go!

               MERRY hurries off... EOMER watches the YOUNG HOBBIT leave.

                                     EOMER
                         You should not encourage him.

                                     EOWYN
                         And you should not doubt him.

                                     EOMER
                         I do not doubt his heart... Only the 
                         reach of his arm.

               CLOSE ON: GAMLING stifles a laugh... EOWYN turns on both of 
               them...

                                     EOWYN
                         Why should Merry be left behind? He 
                         has as much cause to go to war as 
                         you.
                              (to herself)
                         Why can he not fight for those he 
                         loves?

               ANGLE ON: At the PLATEAU edge, a GUARD looks down the STEEP 
               PRECIPICE as a HORSE and RIDER move along the RIDGE...

               EXT. DUNHARROW TRACK - NIGHT

               ANGLES ON: The HOODED FIGURE slowly RIDES up the NARROW ZIGZAG 
               TRACK leading up to the PLATEAU...

               INT. ARAGORN'S TENT, DUNHARROW - NIGHT

               ANGLE ON: ARAGORN tosses in his SLEEP, disturbed by images 
               and voices...

                                     GANDALF (V.O.)
                         Look to the Black Ships...

               In ARAGORN'S dream ARWEN suddenly WAKES...

                                     ARWEN (V.O.)
                         I choose a mortal life... I wish I 
                         could have seen him, one last time...

               As ARWEN lies dying, the EVENSTAR falls from her fingers...

               At that moment, ARAGORN wakes, his SWORD quickly in his 
               HAND... A GUARD stands in the DOORWAY...

                                     GUARD
                         King Theoden awaits you, my Lord.

               EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - NIGHT

               ARAGORN hurries towards THEODEN'S TENT...

               INT. THEODEN'S TENT, DUNHARROW PLATEAU - NIGHT

               ANGLE ON: THEODEN looks up as ARAGORN enters.

                                     THEODEN
                         I take my leave.

               ANGLE ON: THEODEN bows slightly to the HOODED FIGURE and 
               LEAVES, shooting ARAGORN a strange look as he goes...

               CLOSE ON: The FIGURE stands and pulls back the HOOD... to 
               reveal... ELROND.

                                     ARAGORN
                         My Lord, Elrond.

                                     ELROND
                         I come on behalf of one whom I love.

               ELROND'S face is ETCHED with PAIN...

                                     ELROND
                         Arwen is dying.

               ANGLE ON: ARAGORN receiving this news... ASHEN-FACED.

                                     ARAGORN
                         She stayed?

                                     ELROND
                         She will not long survive the evil 
                         that now spreads from Mordor.

               ELROND'S eyes fall to the EVENSTAR which hangs around 
               ARAGORN'S neck...

                                     ELROND
                         The light of the Evenstar is failing. 
                         As Sauron's power grows, her strength 
                         wanes.

               Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the Ring. The Shadow 
               is upon us, Aragorn, the end has come.

                                     ARAGORN
                         It will not be our end, but his.

                                     ELROND
                         You ride to war, but not to victory. 
                         Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith -- 
                         this you know -- but in secret he 
                         sends another force which will attack 
                         from the river...

               CLOSE ON: ARAGORN looks at ELROND in shock.

                                     ELROND
                         A fleet of Corsair ships sails from 
                         the South.

               FLASH INSERT: A FLEET of BLACK SAILS moving along a SILVER 
               RIBBON of WATER.

                                     ELROND
                         They will be in the city in two 
                         days... You're out-numbered, Aragorn. 
                         You need more men.

                                     ARAGORN
                         There are none.

               ELROND hesitates a BEAT...

                                     ELROND
                              (quietly)
                         There are those who dwell in the 
                         mountain.

               A SUDDEN WIND rushes through the TENT, lifting HANGINGS, 
               scattering MAPS, knocking over GOBLETS...

               As ARAGORN looks at ELROND, an IMAGE FLASHES in his MIND'S 
               EYE... The GHOSTLY FIGURE on the DIMHOLT ROAD...

               ARAGORN looks at ELROND in shock...

                                     ARAGORN
                         Murderers, traitors -- you would 
                         call upon them to fight? They believe 
                         in nothing. They answer to no-one.

                                     ELROND
                         They will answer to the King of 
                         Condor.

               ARAGORN'S eyes fall to a PLAIN BLACK SCABBARD, which ELROND 
               draws from beneath his robes.

               CLOSE ON: ELROND'S long white fingers draw the hilt of a 
               SWORD from the scabbard to reveal... a ELVEN SWORD glints in 
               the firelight!

                                     ELROND
                         Anduril, flame of the West... forged 
                         from the shards of Narsil.

               ARAGORN takes the sword... staring at it in wonder.

                                     ARAGORN
                         Sauron will not have forgotten the 
                         sword of Elendil...

               ARAGORN draws the long blade from its sheath...

                                     ARAGORN
                         ...the blade that was broken shall 
                         return to Minas Tirith.

                                     ELROND
                         The man who can wield the power of 
                         this sword can summon to him an army 
                         more deadly than any that walks this 
                         earth.

               ELROND stares hard at ARAGORN...

                                     ELROND
                         Put aside the Ranger -- become who 
                         you were born to be -- take the 
                         Dimhplt Road.

               A HEAVY SILENCE hangs in the room.

                                     ELROND
                              (ELVISH: with subtitles)
                         Onen i-estel Edain.
                         <I give hope to Men>

                                     ARAGORN
                              (ELVISH: with subtitles)
                         U-chebin estel anim.
                         <I keep none for myself.>

               ANGLE ON: ARAGORN re-sheathes the SWORD.

               EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - NIGHT

               ANGLE ON: As ARAGORN readies BREGO for leaving EOWYN 
               approaches... her temper barely held in check.

                                     EOWYN
                         Why are you doing this?

               ARAGORN looks over his shoulder at her...

                                     EOWYN
                         The war lies to the East. You cannot 
                         leave on the eve of battle. You cannot 
                         abandon the men.

                                     ARAGORN
                         Eowyn...

                                     EOWYN
                         We need you here --

               ARAGORN rounds on her ...

                                     ARAGORN
                         Why have you come?

                                     EOWYN
                              (hesitant)
                         Do you not know?

               ARAGORN looks at her sadly, not wanting to hurt her.

                                     ARAGORN
                              (gentle)
                         It is but a shadow and a thought 
                         that you love... I cannot give you 
                         what you seek.

               EOWYN steps back at though STRUCK... she watches stricken as 
               ARAGORN leaves...

               EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - NIGHT

               ANGLE ON: ARAGORN leads his horse through the TENTS towards 
               the DIMHOLT ROAD.

               A LIGHT FLARES ahead of him...

               ANGLE ON: A SHORT FIGURE steps out of the SHADOWS... PIPE in 
               hand.

                                     GIMLI
                         And just where do you think you're 
                         off to?

               ARAGORN looks at GIMLI -- GRATEFUL for his COURAGE but 
               determined to go ALONE.

                                     ARAGORN
                         Not this time... This time you must 
                         stay, my friend.

                                     LEGOLAS (O.S.)
                         Have you learnt nothing of the 
                         stubbornness of Dwarves?

               ANGLE ON: ARAGORN looks at LEGOLAS as he appears, leading 
               his HORSE -- already SADDLED.

               GIMLI steps closer to ARAGORN.

                                     GIMLI
                         You might as well accept it -- we're 
                         going with you, laddie.

               ARAGORN shakes his head, smiling his acceptance.

               ANGLE ON: ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI as they slowly ride 
               towards the BACK of the PLATEAU... Past the ANCIENT STANDING 
               STONES that lead to the NARROW PASS.

               EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - NIGHT

               ANGLE ON: THEODEN and GAMLING watch the RETREATING FIGURES 
               of ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI... ROHAN SOLDIERS emerge from 
               their tents, crestfallen to see ARAGORN leave.

               ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI disappear into the SHADOWS of the 
               MOUNTAINS. The ROHAN SOLDIERS murmur among themselves, "What's 
               happening?", "Where's he going?"

                                     GAMLING
                         Lord Aragorn!

                                     ROHAN SOLDIER (O.S.)
                         Why does he leave on the eve of 
                         battle?

                                     GAMLING
                         He leaves because there is no hope.

               CLOSE ON: THEODEN as he moves forward.

                                     THEODEN
                         He leaves because he must.

                                     GAMLING
                         Too few have come. We cannot defeat 
                         the armies of Mordor.

                                     THEODEN
                         No, we cannot...
                              (surveying his 
                              frightened Men)
                         But we will meet them in battle, 
                         nonetheless.

               EXT. THEODEN'S TENT, DUNHARROW PLATEAU - DAWN

               ANGLE ON: THEODEN looks at EOWYN who stands as if turned to 
               stone... she is looking up at a LIGHTENING SKY... The QUIET 
               before the MEN depart for WAR...

                                     THEODEN
                              (gentle)
                         I have left instruction: the people 
                         are to follow your rule in my stead... 
                         take up my seat in the Golden Hall... 
                         long may you defend Edoras if the 
                         battle goes ill.

               ANGLE ON: EOWYN turns to the KING... her FACE a BLANK...

               She speaks without emotion.

                                     EOWYN
                         What other duty would you have me 
                         do, my Lord?

               THEODEN moves towards her, taking up her HAND...

                                     THEODEN
                              (quiet)
                         Duty? ...No, I would have you smile 
                         again -- not grieve for those whose 
                         time has come.

               EOWYN slowly lifts her head...

                                     THEODEN
                         You shall live to see these days 
                         renewed.

               CLOSE ON: THEODEN lifts EOWYN faces to look into her EYES...

                                     THEODEN
                              (whisper)
                         No more despair.

               EXT. DIMHOLT ROAD - DAY

               ANGLE ON: ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI make their way up a 
               GLOOMY CANYON, shadowed by BLACK FIR TREES. The shadowed 
               ridges of the DWIMORBERG MOUNTAIN rise BEFORE THEM.

               It is a SPOOKY PLACE.

                                     GIMLI
                         What kind of an army would linger in 
                         such a place?

                                     LEGOLAS
                         One that is cursed... Long ago the 
                         Men of the Mountain swore an oath to 
                         the last King of Condor -- to come 
                         to his aid, to fight, but when the 
                         time came, when Condor's need was 
                         dire, they fled... Vanishing into 
                         the darkness of the mountain... And 
                         so Isildur cursed them -- never to 
                         rest until they had fulfilled their 
                         pledge.

               SILENCE surrounds them, there are no birds, no wind. Only 
               the OMINOUSLY MUFFLED THUD of their horses hooves on the 
               dank FIRNEEDLES.

               EXT. DIMHOLT GLEN - DAY

               ANGLE ON: Before them, at the ROOT OF THE MOUNTAIN, a SHEER 
               WALL of ROCK towers...

                                     GIMLI
                              (terrified whisper)
                         The very warmth of my blood seems 
                         stolen away.

               Within the walls, a creepy DARK DOOR gapes like a mouth of 
               night. SIGNS and FIGURES are carved above its WIDE ARCH.

                                     LEGOLAS
                              (translating)
                         The way is shut. It was made by those 
                         who are dead, and the Dead keep it. 
                         The way is shut.

               AT THAT MOMENT: A CHILL WIND seems to rush out of the 
               DOORWAY... ARAGORN stares into the BLACKNESS, his HAIR BLOWING 
               WILDLY. The HORSES REAR and BUCK in terror, turning and 
               GALLOPING AWAY.

                                     ARAGORN
                         Brego!

               The three HORSES DISAPPEAR... ARAGORN turns resolutely towards 
               the DOORWAY...

                                     ARAGORN
                              (steely resolve)
                         I do not fear death...

               ANGLE ON: ARAGORN WALKING into the BLACKNESS.

               LEGOLAS quickly follows... swallowed by the DARKNESS.

               CLOSE ON: GIMLI left ALONE... He hesitates, struggling with 
               his FEAR.

                                     GIMLI
                         Well, this is a thing unheard of... 
                         An Elf will go underground when a 
                         Dwarf dare not.
                              (gritting his teeth)
                         Oh! I'd never hear the end of it!

               GIMLI plunges into the TUNNEL behind the OTHERS!

               EXT. DUNHARROW ENCAMPMENT - DAWN

               MUCH ACTIVITY... HORNS SOUND... the ENTIRE CAMP is on the 
               MOVE... fires are DOUSED, TENTS pulled down, HORSES saddled.

               EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - DAWN

               ANGLE ON: THEODEN strides through the CAMP, EOMER at his 
               SIDE.

                                     THEODEN
                         We must ride light and swift. It's a 
                         long road ahead... and man and beast 
                         must reach the end with the strength 
                         to fight.

               ANGLE ON: MERRY... preparing a LITTLE PONY with a SADDLE and 
               SUPPLIES. He is wearing an OVERSIZED HELMET and ROHIRRIM 
               CLOTHING... he looks at once NERVOUS and EXCITED.

               KING THEODEN breaks away from a COLUMN and rides up to MERRY.

                                     THEODEN
                              (gently)
                         Little Hobbits do not belong in war, 
                         Master Meriadoc!

                                     MERRY
                         All my friends have gone to battle. 
                         I would be ashamed to be left behind!

                                     THEODEN
                         It is a three day gallop to Minas 
                         Tirith. None of my Riders can bear 
                         you as a burden.

                                     MERRY
                         But... I want to fight!

                                     THEODEN
                         I will say no more.

               KING THEODEN wheels his HORSE away...

               MERRY is bitterly DISAPPOINTED. He stands, head down -- a 
               TINY DEJECTED FIGURE -- as the MIGHTY ROHIRRIM on their LARGE 
               HORSES ride by... a jangling sea of HELMETS, SHIELDS and 
               BANNERS.

               SUDDENLY... MERRY is plucked off the ground! A SOLDIER has 
               snatched him by the collar... and plonked him down on their 
               SADDLE!

               CLOSE ON: MERRY twists around, looking up at the SOLDIER...

               Beneath a HELMET and MAIL HOOD is...

               ...EOWYN, disguised as a MAN!

                                     EOWYN
                              (grimly)
                         Ride with me.

                                     MERRY
                         My Lady!

               CLOSE ON: MERRY'S face visible under the CAPE... looking 
               EXCITED!

                                     EOMER
                              (shouting above the 
                              din)
                         Move out -- move out!

                                     THEODEN
                         Ride! Ride now, for Gondor!

               EXT. DUNHARROW VALLEY - DAWN

               HIGH WIDE: The VALLEY FLOOR as THOUSANDS of HORSEMEN ride 
               out after their KING.

               EXT. PELENNOR FIELDS/MINAS TIRITH - DAY

               ANGLE ON: GREAT SIEGE TOWERS and CATAPULTS are ROLLING across 
               the PELENNOR FIELDS... Thousands of FLAMING TORCHES light 
               the snarling, slathering MORGUL ORCS... marching in RAGGED 
               RANKS.

               ANGLES ON: Flowing torrents of ORCS stream past CAVE TROLLS, 
               beating the DRUMS OF WAR... MINAS TIRITH lies ahead -- only 
               TWO MILES AWAY!

               INT. PATHS OF THE DEAD CAVERN - DAY

               ANGLE ON: ARAGORN leads LEGOLAS and GIMLI into a WIDE 
               CAVERN... he WAVES HIS TORCH through the DARKNESS: 
               ILLUMINATING a HUGE, CAVERN...

               A ghastly CRACKING NOISE, like stone being sundered, cuts 
               through the SILENCE.

               A GHOSTLY FIGURE step from the ROCK WALLS!

               ANGLES ON: ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI look on in HORROR, as 
               a MUMMIFIED SPECTRE looms before them: EYELESS SOCKETS... 
               ROTTEN TEETH... a pale SICKLY GLOW... the KING OF THE DEAD!

               FOG SWIRLS around as the GHOST SNARLS at ARAGORN...

                                     KING OF THE DEAD
                         Who enters my domain?

               ARAGORN moves forward... unflinching...

                                     ARAGORN
                         One who will have your allegiance.

                                     KING OF THE DEAD
                              (snarl)
                         The dead do not suffer the living to 
                         pass...

                                     ARAGORN
                         You will suffer me!

               The KING OF THE DEAD'S MALEVOLENT LAUGH echoes through the 
               CAVES...

               ANGLE ON: The FOG suddenly ROLLS BACK, forming a retreating 
               wall of GREY VAPOUR... slowly, RANK upon RANK of SPECTRAL 
               WARRIORS are revealed! GHOULISH FACES... RUSTING WEAPONS... 
               TATTERED BANNERS.

               WIDE ON: The FOG reveals a DEAD ARMY of MANY THOUSANDS... 
               assembled around the CAVERN!

               ANGLE ON: ARAGORN stares GRIMLY at the KING OF THE DEAD.

               CLOSE ON: THE KING of the DEAD as he smiles evilly at 
               ARAGORN... ARAGORN holds his GAZE...

                                     KING OF THE DEAD
                              (chilling)
                         The way is shut...

               THE KING of the DEAD moves relentlessly towards ARAGORN...

                                     KING OF THE DEAD
                         It was made by those who are Dead 
                         and the Dead keep it...

               WIDE: ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI are now surrounded by an 
               ARMY of the DEAD...

                                     KING OF THE DEAD
                         The way is shut. Now, you must die.

               ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS fires an ARROW at the KING OF THE DEAD... 
               it PASSES STRAIGHT THROUGH!

               ARAGORN keeps moving forward, his eyes locked on the SPECTRE.

                                     ARAGORN
                              (desperate)
                         I summon you to fulfil your oath!

               ANGLE ON: The KING OF THE DEAD SNARLS and raises his DEADLY 
               SWORD above ARAGORN' S HEAD!

                                     KING OF THE DEAD
                              (raspy yell)
                         None but the King of Gondor may 
                         command me!

               QUICK BEAT: ARAGORN RAISES ANDURIL...

               With a TERRIFYING SHRIEK, THE KING of the DEAD SWEEPS his 
               SWORD towards ARAGORN'S HEAD!

               SLOW MOTION: ARAGORN raises his SWORD in ANSWER... a LOW 
               WHISTLE as it SWEEPS through the AIR...

               CLANG! The BLADE OF ANDURIL clashes with the SPECTRAL SWORD... 
               the SHARP RING of METAL reverberates through the CAVERNS!

               CLOSE ON: THE KING of the DEAD stares at ARAGORN in DISBELIEF.

                                     KING OF THE DEAD
                              (fearful)
                         It cannot be -- that line was broken!

               ANGLE ON: ARAGORN grabs the SHOCKED GHOST by the NECK...

               ARAGORN holds the SHARP BLADE against the GHOST'S THROAT!

                                     ARAGORN
                         It has been remade!

               SILENCE.

               ARAGORN releases the KING OF THE DEAD... he ADDRESSES the 
               GHOST ARMY.

                                     ARAGORN
                         Fight for us and regain your honour!

               GHOSTLY FACES stare hollow-eyed at ARAGORN...

                                     ARAGORN
                              (yelling)
                         What say you?

               SILENCE.

                                     ARAGORN
                         What say you?

                                     GIMLI
                         Aghh! Your wasting your time, Aragorn. 
                         They had no honour in life, they 
                         have none now in death.

                                     ARAGORN
                              (yelling)
                         I am Isildur's heir. Fight for me 
                         and I will hold your oath fulfilled.

               ANGLE ON: The HUGE GATE swings open, revealing... FARAMIR'S 
               badly wounded HORSE... dragging FARAMIR behind! Both the 
               HORSE and FARAMIR are impaled with ORC ARROWS!

                                     IORLAS

               DENETHOR bends to the STRETCHER bearing his SON.

               At his ORDERS, the GREAT CATAPULTS fire THWAT! THWAT! THWAT!

               EXT. MINAS TIRITH STREETS - DAY

               The ORC CATAPULTS do not fire rocks...

               HORROR sweeps through the streets of MINAS TIRITH as the 
               SEVERED HEADS of FARAMIR'S HORSEMEN land amongst the SOLDIERS!

                         My son is dead. My line is ended.

               he STARES in SHOCKED DISBELIEF at the VISTA spread out BELOW.

               HIGH WIDE ANGLE: A FULL VIEW of the ORC ARMY... from the TOP 
               of MINAS TIRITH.

               75,000 ORCS are spread out across the PELENNOR FIELDS like a 
               sea of black ANTS.

               CLOSE ON: TROLLS load the CATAPULTS with ROCKS.

               BATTERING RAMS and SIEGE TOWERS are hauled on CHAINS.

               Thousands of flickering TORCHES give the army the look of a 
               moving city in the MURKY MORDOR TWILIGHT.

                         Kill the trolls! Bring them down!

               TOO LATE! The TOWERS reach the walls, their DOORS crashing 
               down, releasing ORCS directly onto the LOWER LEVELS.

               As the ORC swarm from the TOWER, GANDALF realises PIPPIN has 
               come down from the CITADEL...

                                     GANDALF
                         Peregrin Took -- go back to the 
                         citadel!

                                     PIPPIN
                              (stupor)
                         They called us out to fight...

               PIPPIN looks on stunned, as a HUGE ORC leaps towards him...

               GANDALF intercepts the BEAST, striking him with his STAFF...

                                     GANDALF
                              (urgency)
                         This is no place for a Hobbit!

               GANDALF welds his STAFF, cutting through the attacking ORC 
               with EASE... BEHIND him, an ORC prepares to cut down 
               GANDALF... PIPPIN instinctively slashes his SWORD at him.

               ANGLE ON: GANDALF turns on PIPPIN, smiling despite himself.

                                     GANDALF
                         Guard of the Citadel, indeed! Now, 
                         back up the hill -- quickly! Quickly!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PELENNOR FIELDS - DUSK

               ANGLE ON: Out of BLACK SWIRLING BATTLE. SMOKE crawls an IRON 
               MONSTER! A MASSIVE WHEELED BATTERING RAM... 60 FEET HIGH and 
               150 FEET LONG... pushed by 20 huge MOUNTAIN TROLLS... a 
               MASSIVE IRON HEAD, cast in the likeness of a SNARLING WOLF!

               ...this is GROND... the BATTERING RAM FROM HELL! The Orc are 
               chanting as the BEAST is wheeled closer and closer to the 
               GATES...

                                     ORCS
                         Grond! Grond! Grond!

               EXT. MINAS TIRITH BATTLEMENTS - DUSK

               CLOSE ON: GANDALF... blanching at the sight of this crawling 
               IRON MONSTER!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PASS OF CIRITH UNGOL, TUNNEL MOUTH - DAY

               ANGLE ON: GOLLUM leads FRODO up a LONG RAVINE between COLUMNS 
               of TORN and WEATHERED ROCK.

               AHEAD is a GREAT GREY WALL, a last huge mass of 
               mountainstone... and in the SHADOWS at the base of the 
               TOWERING ROCK lies a TUNNEL.

               FRODO reacts to the FOUL STENCH coming out of the BLACK HOLE.

                                     FRODO
                              (exhausted)
                         What is this place?

                                     GOLLUM
                         Master must go inside the tunnel.

                                     FRODO
                         Now that I'm here, I don't think I 
                         want to.

               CLOSE ON: SMEAGOL sensing his PLAN unravelling. Everything 
               depends on FRODO going inside the TUNNEL

                                     SMEAGOL
                         It's the only way.
                              (GOLLUM; slyly)
                         Go in -- or go back.

               FRODO stares into the darkness...

                                     FRODO
                              (under his breath)
                         I can't go back.

               CLOSE ON: GOLLUM, his sparse oily hair hanging like rank 
               weed over his hooded eyes...

               Drawing a DEEP BREATH, FRODO follows GOLLUM into the TUNNEL.

               INT. SHELOB'S TUNNEL - DAY

               FRODO NEARLY GAGS.

                                     FRODO
                         What's that smell?

                                     GOLLUM
                              (lying)
                         Orcses filth! Orcses come in here 
                         sometimes.

               They continue on, deep into the DARK TUNNEL... FRODO is 
               feeling his way in the dark, following the SOUND of GOLLUM'S 
               scampering.

                                     GOLLUM (O.S.)
                              (disembodied)
                         Hurry!

               FRODO follows the sound of GOLLUM's voice. He is VERY TIRED.

                                     GOLLUM (O.S.)
                              (disembodied)
                         This way. 

               FRODO cannot see GOLLUM in the MURKY TUNNEL...

                                     FRODO
                         Smeagol!

                                     GOLLUM (O.S.)
                              (disembodied)
                         Over here.

               FRODO slips as he tries to follow the voice... He puts his 
               HAND to the WALL to STEADY HIMSELF but quickly YANKS it 
               away... STRANDS of a WHITE THREAD stuck to his HAND.

                                     FRODO
                         It's sticky... What is it?

               GOLLUM is nowhere to be seen... only his voice echoes back 
               down the LABYRINTH of TUNNELS.

                                     GOLLUM (O.S.)
                         You will see... Oh, yes... You will 
                         see.

               FRODO FREEZES!

                                     FRODO
                              (nervous)
                         Smeagol! Smeagol!

               NO ANSWER, no echo, not even a tremor in the air.

                                     FRODO
                              (panicked)
                         Smeagol!

               CLOSE ON: FRODO realises with HORROR that GOLLUM has deserted 
               him!

                                     FRODO
                              (whisper)
                         Sam...

               CLOSE ON: FRODO breathing hard... passing all manner of 
               creatures, trussed up in evil WEB-LIKE material...

               A BUBBLING HISS can be heard... There is a CREAKING as some 
               great JOINTED THING moves with slow purpose in the DARK...

               FRODO begins to run in BLIND PANIC...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. CIRITH UNGOL STAIRS - DAY

               SAM stumbles blindly down the ANCIENT STAIRS, reckless and 
               uncaring, his face pale and devastated.

               CLOSE ON: SAM'S FOOT slips...

               ...SUDDENLY, as if the ground has given way beneath him, SAM 
               is slipping and sliding dangerously OUT OF CONTROL.

               ANGLE ON: SAM thudding into a LARGE ROCK, which saves him 
               from tumbling headlong over the PRECIPICE.

               Something catches SAM'S EYE... he stares, barely breathing.

               CLOSE ON: A package of LEMBAS BREAD...

               ANGLE ON: SAM looking BACK UP the LONG STEEP STAIR...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. SHELOB'S TUNNEL - DAY

               FRODO is running BLINDLY... He falls, trapped in the sticky 
               substance which CLINGS to him. As he lays on the ground, 
               unable to move, a VOICE comes to him as if from a distant 
               memory...

                                     GALADRIEL (V.O.)
                         I give you the light of Earendil -- 
                         our most beloved star. May it be a 
                         light for you in dark places when 
                         all other lights go out.

               CLOSE ON: FRODO fumbles in his JACKET, FEAR growing in him 
               he pulls out the GLASS PHIAL -- his GIFT from GALADRIEL -- 
               he holds it aloft.

                                     FRODO
                              (stronger)
                         Aiya Earendil Elenion Ancalima!

               The PHIAL flickers... kindles into a SILVER FLAME -- a BRIGHT 
               RADIANT STARLIGHT!

               LOW ANGLE ON: The LIGHT instantly REVEALS a HUGE LOATHSOME 
               SPIDER... towering over FRODO!

               CLOSE ON: SHELOB the SPIDER HISSES at the LIGHT! TWO great 
               clusters of many-windowed EYES protrude from her bulbous 
               head. Her LEGS are bent, with a 12 FOOT SPAN and HAIRS that 
               stick out like steel spines. Her HUGE, SWOLLEN BODY, a vast 
               bloated bag, sways and sags between her legs. Her age-old 
               BLACK HIDE is knobbly and pitted, blotchy with LIVID MARKS... 
               but her belly underneath is PALE and LUMINOUS.

               SHELOB beats the air with her FORELEGS.

               ANGLE ON: Calling up all his remaining STRENGTH and 
               RESOLUTION, FRODO forces his LEGS to MOVE... he backs away -- 
               keeping his EYES on SHELOB.

               SHELOB crawls SLOWLY towards him .. then, with sudden, hideous 
               SPEED, she ATTACKS!

               She lashes out with her FRONT LEGS... FRODO is flung back... 
               the GLASS PHIAL clatters to the TUNNEL FLOOR, casting an 
               eerie LOW LIGHT.

               SHELOB squats above FRODO, her EYE CLUSTERS fidgeting with 
               hideous delight, gloating over a prey trapped beyond all 
               hope of escape.

               SUDDENLY! FRODO draws STING! He slashes wildly at the GIANT 
               SPIDER... hewing off the TIP of A LEG!

               SHELOB SPASMS... a WILD BLUR of thrashing LEGS!

               ANGLE ON: FRODO leaps to his feet and RUNS -- not even pausing 
               to pick up the PHIAL of LIGHT!

               TRACKING BACK: with FRODO as he careers blindly down NARROW 
               TUNNELS, gasping in the CHOKING AIR... looking back over his 
               shoulder for any sign of SHELOB.

               ANGLE ON: FRODO sees the TUNNEL EXIT ahead...

               ...just as he runs straight into a great COBWEB!

               CLOSE ON: FRODO... eyes wild with fear... as he tries to 
               wrench STING free of the STICKY WEB.

                                     GOLLUM (O.S.)
                              (sing-song)
                         Naughty little fly, Why does it cry?

               ANGLE ON: GOLLUM on the other side of the WEB...

                                     GOLLUM
                         Caught in a web. Soon you'll be... 
                         Eaten!

               ANGLE ON: FRODO as he SLASHES WILDLY with STING. The SHINING 
               BLADE of STING as it hacks through the FIBROUS STRANDS. They 
               whip and snap back into FRODO'S FACE as he cuts himself free.

               ANGLE ON: Back up the TUNNEL -- lit by the LIGHT OF GALADRIEL -- 
               SHELOB'S HEAVING SHADOW approaches...

               CLOSE ON: GOLLUM watches in mounting disbelief as STING 
               slashes through the WEB... DISBELIEF turns to FEAR as SHELOB 
               gets closer and closer, GOLLUM quickly turns and BOLTS...

               FRODO hacks at the WEB and with a last desperate LUNGE, frees 
               himself... STING is caught in the WEB... FRODO leaves the 
               SWORD and THROWS HIMSELF through a narrow CREVICE...

               EXT. PASS OF CIRITH UNGOL - DAY

               ANGLE ON: FRODO stumbles out of SHELOB'S LAIR... Tumbling 
               onto COLD ROCK.

               ANGLE ON: FRODO covered in COBWEBS, wild-eyed and drenched 
               in SWEAT... He looks up as GOLLUM lunges at him.

                                     GOLLUM
                         Got away did it, Precious? Not this 
                         time, not this time!

               GOLLUM and FRODO fight... Rolling on the GROUND towards the 
               EDGE of a PRECIPICE...

               FRODO pins GOLLUM on the ground, hands around his throat.

                                     SMEAGOL
                              (pleading)
                         It wasn't us! It wasn't us! Smeagol 
                         wouldn't hurt Master.

               ANGLE ON: FRODO'S fingers squeeze tighter around GOLLUM'S 
               THROAT.

                                     SMEAGOL
                         Smeagol promised. You must believe 
                         us. It was the Precious -- the 
                         Precious made us to do it.

               FRODO has a sudden moment of SELF REALISATION and releases 
               GOLLUM, horrified at his VIOLENCE.

               ANGLE ON: GOLLUM cowering back... COUGHING and SPLUTTERING.

               ANGLE ON: FRODO looking at SMEAGOL, in SHOCK, he gets to his 
               FEET.

                                     FRODO
                              (shaky)
                         I have to destroy it, Smeagol. I 
                         have to destroy it for both our sakes.

               SMEAGOL stares at FRODO in DISBELIEF... in a FURY he LUNGES 
               at FRODO who falls backwards, dangerously close to the edge 
               of the PRECIPICE -- GOLLUM tumbles over FRODO's BODY and 
               FALLS to the bottom of the RAVINE...

               EXT. PASS OF CIRITH UNGOL - NIGHT

               FRODO, overcome with EXHAUSTION, stumbles down the steep 
               stairs of CIRITH UNGOL... He is full of REMORSE at his 
               TREATMENT of SAM...

                                     FRODO
                         I'm so sorry, Sam...

               FRODO falls to his knees --

                                     FRODO
                         ...so sorry...

               EXT. FRODO'S DREAM, LOTHLORIEN - DAY

               CLOSE ON: FRODO lands on SOFT GREEN GRASS.

               SUN DRENCHED IMAGES: Of trees... of fields... of LOTHLORIEN

                         This task was appointed to you, Frodo 
                         of the Shire. If you do not find a 
                         way... no one will.

               GALADRIEL leans down towards FRODO, OFFERING her hand... for 
               a beat, FRODO stares at her... torn, not wanting to go on, 
               wanting to lie down... But he knows what he must do.

               ANGLE ON: FRODO... as he is LIFTED to HIS FEET.

               ANGLE ON: FRODO -- once again in the dark, rank, tunnels of 
               the PASS of CIRITH UNGOL... He goes on.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MINAS TIRITH STREETS - NIGHT

               ANGLES ON: FLAMING MISSILES rain down on the CITY!

               A DEEP BOOM!

               GROND thuds against the MINAS TIRITH GATE... sending a 
               VIBRATION running through the city!

               ANGLE ON: GANDALF, on SHADOWFAX, leads SEVERAL HUNDRED 
               GONDORIAN FOOT SOLDIERS down through the streets.

                                     GANDALF
                         To the Gates! Man the Gates!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MINAS TIRITH, COURT OF THE KINGS - NIGHT

               PIPPIN watches as FARAMIR'S UNCONSCIOUS BODY is carried on 
               the STRETCHER by DENETHOR'S SERVANTS lead by DENETHOR... it 
               has the atmosphere of a FUNERAL.

               INT. MINAS TIRITH, STEWARD'S TOMB - NIGHT

               ANGLE ON: An IRON DOOR creaks OPEN... FARAMIR'S PROCESSION 
               enters a WIDE VAULTED CHAMBER.

               The LANTERN LIGHT throws great SHADOWS upon the SHROUDED 
               WALLS of a wide VAULTED CHAMBER. ROW upon ROW of MARBLE TOMBS 
               are visible in the DIM LIGHT. Upon each TOMB lies a SLEEPING 
               FORM, carved in STONE, hands folded.

               DENETHOR speaks in a HUSHED VOICE...

                                     DENETHOR
                              (whisper)
                         No tomb for Denethor and Faramir. No 
                         long slow sleep of death embalmed... 
                         we shall burn -- like the heathen 
                         kings of old!

               The SERVANTS place FARAMIR'S UNCONSCIOUS BODY on a STONE 
               TABLE in the centre of the CHAMBER. They stand, heads bowed... 
               as MOURNERS beside a bed of death.

               DENETHOR turns to his SERVANTS.

                                     DENETHOR
                         Bring wood and oil...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MINAS TIRITH GATES - NIGHT

               BOOOMM! The GATE SPLINTERS under GROND'S mighty weight...

               Behind the GATES the GONDORIAN FOOT SOLDIERS are FEARFUL...

               GANDALF rallies the line of BOWMEN as they wait in front of 
               the GREAT DOORS... their COURAGE wavering with each CRASHING 
               BLOW...

                                     GANDALF
                              (commanding)
                         Steady! Steady!

               SUDDENLY the FEARSOME HEAD protrudes into the MINAS TIRITH!

                                     GANDALF
                         You are soldiers of Gondor! No matter 
                         what comes through that gate you 
                         will stand your ground!

               Within MOMENTS the GATE is smashed and GIANT CAVE TROLLS 
               enter into the FIRST CIRCLE of MINAS TIRITH, under the archway 
               that no enemy had ever passed!

                                     GANDALF
                              (yelling)
                         Fire!

               ROWS of ARCHERS fire off a VOLLEY of ARROWS but the TROLLS 
               continue to SMASH the FOOT SOLDIERS with their giant CLUBS... 
               ORCS swarm through the OPENING and the PITCHED, HAND-To-HAND 
               BATTLE spills into FLAMES and BLACKENED, SMOULDERING 
               BUILDINGS... through the streets of MINAS TIRITH.

               ANGLE ON: With a ROAR, GANDALF leads a COUNTER ATTACK on 
               SHADOWFAX, followed by SEVERAL HUNDRED GONDORIAN FOOT 
               SOLDIERS!

               THOUSANDS OF ORCS swarm in through the CITY GATES... the 
               FIRST LEVEL is breached!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PASS OF CIRITH UNGOL - DAY

               ANGLE ON: FRODO STAGGERS through the PASS OF CIRITH UNGOL... 
               the weight of the RING, dragging at his neck.

               He MOVES FORWARD, fueled by a GRIM RESOLVE...

               ANGLE ON: FRODO starts climbing a STONE STAIRCASE that climbs 
               through a NARROW PASS... TALL PEAKS rise on either side, 
               like pillars holding up a sagging sky.

               AHEAD is the SUMMIT of CIRITH UNGOL... and an ORC WATCH TOWER! 
               A FAINT LIGHT glows from within the STONE TOWER... the PATH 
               over the SUMMIT is in FULL VIEW of the ORCS.

               FRODO stays CLOSE to the ROCK WALL, masked by SHADOWS.

               LOW ANGLE: Behind FRODO, SHELOB APPEARS! With hideous STEALTH, 
               she follows FRODO...

               ANGLE ON: FRODO slowly climbing the STONE STAIRS... his GAZE 
               and CONCENTRATION on the ORC TOWER. Behind him, SHELOB lurches 
               into a HORRIBLE SCUTTLE down the SHEER ROCK FACE.

               CLOSE ON: FRODO suddenly senses the LURKING MALICE... he 
               SPINS AROUND: Before he can react, SHELOB VICIOUSLY STABS 
               FRODO in the NECK with her monstrous abdominal STINGER!

               FRODO instantly goes LIMP... SHELOB'S LEGS catch him as he 
               falls... she quickly starts WEAVING COBWEBS around him. With 
               great dexterity, she tumbles the LITTLE HOBBIT over and over 
               in her LEGS, binding him in WEB from HEAD to TOE!

               SUDDENLY!... The RAZOR SHARP EDGE of a SWORD comes into shot.

               REVEAL ON: SAMWISE GAMGEE stands before the GIANT SPIDER -- 
               STING clutched in one hand, the SHINING PHIAL in the other!

                                     SAM
                         Let him go, you filth!

               SHELOB HISSES at SAM... DROPPING FRODO... he ROLLS down the 
               STAIRS in his WEB COCOON.

                                     SAM
                         You will not touch him again!

               SAM moves forward, a fell light in his normally friendly 
               eyes

                                     SAM
                         Come on and finish it!

               SAM SWINGS the small sword... SLASHING upward!

               ANGLE ON: SHELOB HISSES and REARS above SAM, her STINGER 
               dribbling with VENOM!

               SAM ducks inside the arch of her LEGS and STABS STING into 
               one of her EYE CLUSTERS!

               CLOSE ON: SHELOB SCREAMS, her MANDIBLES thrashing wildly, 
               GREEN OOZE trickling from her WOUNDED EYE.

               With HIND LEGS, SHELOB picks SAM off the ground and TOSSES 
               him BACKWARDS! SAM lands heavily... and SHELOB POUNCES!

               ANGLE ON: SHELOB heaves the great bag of her BELLY high above 
               SAM'S HEAD. As she splays her legs to drive her huge bulk 
               down on him, SAM lifts the ELVEN BLADE above his head, holding 
               it with TWO HANDS.

               STING slides into SHELOB'S SOFT UNDERBELLY! A SHUDDER runs 
               through her! HEAVING up again, she wrenches herself away 
               from the PAIN... her LIMBS writhing beneath her.

               ANGLE ON: JERKING and QUIVERING, SHELOB crawls to her HOLE, 
               leaving a trail of GREEN-YELLOW SLIME. She SQUEEZES down the 
               HOLE and DISAPPEARS... the SOUND of her BUBBLING MISERY 
               fades...

               ANGLE ON: SAM RACES TO FRODO...

                                     SAM
                              (worried)
                         Mr. Frodo!

               CLOSE ON: SAM RIPS COBWEBS away from FRODO'S HEAD... his 
               FACE is DEATHLY PALE.

                                     SAM
                              (panicking)
                         Oh no! Frodo!

               CLOSE ON: FRODO'S PALE, LIFELESS FACE.

                                     SAM
                         Mr. Frodo! Wake up!

               FRODO'S head LOLLS LIFELESSLY in SAM'S ARMS.

                                     SAM
                              (desperate whisper)
                         Wake up... don't leave me here alone. 
                         Don't go where I can't follow. Wake 
                         up!

               CLOSE ON: FRODO STARING, UNMOVING.

                                     SAM
                              (numbly)
                         Not asleep... Dead.

               SAM lays his FACE on FRODO'S CHEST... WEEPING SOFTLY.

               CLOSE ON: STING'S BLADE GLOWS BLUE!

               SOUNDTRACK: TRAMPING FEET approach... CLINKING METAL... HARSH 
               SHOUTS!

               CLOSE ON: SAM looks up... looks back down FRODO.

               CLOSE ON: SAM looks up at the ORC TOWER and then at STING 
               which is glowing BLUE! ORCS approach -- SAM must make a 
               decision.

               ANGLE ON: A SMALL PARTY of ORCS and URUK-HAI heading down 
               the STAIRS from the WATCH TOWER! ...SHAGRAT leads the URUK-
               HAI, and GORBAG leads the ORCS.

               GORBAG spies FRODO'S BODY...

                                     GORBAG
                         What's this? Looks like Old Shelob's 
                         been having a bit of fun!

                                     SHAGRAT
                         Killed another one, has she?

               ANGLE ON: GORBAG peer curiously at FRODO as he leans down 
               and pokes at FRODO'S LIFELESS BODY.

                                     GORBAG
                         No... this fellow ain't dead.

               CLOSE ON: SAM, hidden in a rock crevice, as SHOCK sweeps 
               across his FACE!

                                     SAM
                              (to himself)
                         Not dead!

                                     GORBAG
                              (Excited)
                         She jabs them with her stinger and 
                         they go as limp as a boned fish. 
                         Then she has her way with them. That's 
                         how she likes to feed -- fresh blood.
                              (yelling)
                         Get him to the Tower!

                                     SAM
                         Samwise, you fool!

               ANGLE ON: The ORCS GRUNT as they lift FRODO... and CARRY him 
               back towards the WATCH TOWER.

                                     ORC 2
                         This fellow will be awake in a few 
                         hours.

                                     GORBAG
                         Then he'll wish he'd never been born.

               ORC LAUGHTER... FRODO is carried up the steep STAIRS...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MINAS TIRITH/STEWARD'S TOMB - NIGHT

               FROM the SHADOWS PIPPIN watches, aghast, as FARAMIR is lain 
               on a FUNERAL PYRE...

               CLOSE ON: DENETHOR kisses FARAMIR'S sweating, FEVERED brow.

                                     DENETHOR
                         The house of his spirit crumbles! He 
                         is burning... already burning.

               ANGLE ON: BUNDLES of DRIED FIREWOOD are being stacked around 
               FARAMIR'S BODY.

               ANGLE ON: PIPPIN, rushes forward, desperately PULLING the 
               FIREWOOD AWAY!

                                     PIPPIN
                              (yelling)
                         He's not dead! He's not dead!

               DENETHOR grabs PIPPIN by the collar! He roughly carries him 
               towards the door.

                                     PIPPIN
                         No! No! No! He's not dead. No!

                                     DENETHOR
                              (menacing)
                         Farewell Peregrin, son of Paladin... 
                         I release you from my service...

               DENETHOR throws PIPPIN outside!

                                     DENETHOR
                         Go now and die in what way seems 
                         best to you.

               DENETHOR SLAMS the DOOR SHUT!

                                     DENETHOR (O.S.)
                              (ordering)
                         Pour oil on the wood!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MINAS TIRITH STREETS - NIGHT

               ANGLE ON: PIPPIN RACES down the STEEP STREETS... passing 
               SOLDIERS running back from the BURNING CITY. GREAT BALLS of 
               FIRE are hurtling through the air... The city is in CHAOS.

                                     PIPPIN
                              (yelling)
                         Gandalf? ...Gandalf?

               AMIDST the FLEEING SOLDIERS...

                                     GANDALF
                         Pull back -- to the second level! 
                         Hurry! Get the women and children 
                         out of here -- get them out!

               PIPPIN desperately pushes against the TIDE of SOLDIERS 
               retreating from the FIGHTING.

               EXT. PELENNOR FIELDS - NIGHT

               GOTHMOG turns to his SECOND LIEUTENANT...

                                     GOTHMOG
                         Move into the city... Kill all in 
                         your path.

                                                             INTERCUT WITH:

               EXT. MINAS TIRITH STREETS

               As ORC run through the STREETS, MEN, WOMEN, and CHILDREN 
               flee... The PITCHED BATTLE continues...

                                     GANDALF
                         Fight! Fight for your lives!

               SUDDENLY! in the midst of the BATTLE, GANDALF turns...

               SHRILL and CLEAR come the sounds of DISTANT HORNS! Off the 
               SIDE of MOUNT MILLDOLLUIN, they dimly ECHO -- WAR HORNS of 
               the west... ROHAN HAS COME!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PELENNOR FIELDS - DAWN

               GOTHMOG turns at the sound of the DISTANT HORNS...

               WIDE ON: 6000 HORSEMEN, lead by THEODEN and EOMER, step up 
               to the SKYLINE...

               ANGLE ON: MINAS TIRITH lies less than a MILE AWAY, down a 
               gentle slope. Over 50,000 ORCS are swarming around the base 
               of the city... thick BLACK SMOKE belches from within it.

               CLOSE ON: MERRY BLANCHES with FEAR... EOWYN puts a comforting 
               hand on his shoulder.

                                     EOWYN
                              (whisper)
                         Courage, Merry... courage for our 
                         friends.

               On the BATTLE FIELD GOTHMOG walks among his troops...

                                     GOTHMOG
                         Form ranks you maggots! Form ranks! 
                         Pikes in front, lances behind.

               The ORCS PREPARE for BATTLE.

               ANGLE ON: THEODEN gallops in front of his ARMY, ISSUING URGENT 
               ORDERS to his CAPTAINS.

                                     THEODEN
                              (urgent yells)
                         Eomer! Take your Eored down the left 
                         flank... Gamling! Follow the King's 
                         banner down the centre. Grimbold, 
                         take your company right after we 
                         pass the wall. Forth and fear no 
                         darkness!

               CLOSE ON: THEODEN rides to the front of his ARMY. He rises 
               in his stirrups, TALL and PROUD, yelling in a clear, LOUD 
               VOICE

                                     THEODEN
                              (stirring call)
                         Arise, arise, Riders of Theoden! 
                         Spears shall be shaken, shields shall 
                         be splintered... a sword day, a red 
                         day 'ere the sun rises!

               ANGLE ON: A RAY of SUNLIGHT escapes through the BLACK CLOUDS, 
               bathing the ROHIRRIM in GOLDEN LIGHT. WEAPONS and ARMOUR 
               GLEAMS... as 6000 HORSEMEN hold their SPEARS aloft!

               Below, on PELENNOR FIELD, the ORC kneel and raise their LANCES 
               in READINESS...

               ANGLE ON: EOWYN, her arm around MERRY before her...

                                     EOWYN
                              (terrified)
                         Whatever happens, stay with me. I'll 
                         look after you.

               MERRY looks on in SHOCK...

               ANGLE ON: As THEODEN rides past the ranks of SOLDIERS he 
               runs his LANCE along their SPEARS... The noise echoes through 
               the RANKS as the WEAPONS of other RIDERS CLATTER in 
               response...

                                     THEODEN
                              (stirring call)
                         Ride now, ride now, ride, ride for 
                         ruin and the world's ending!

               THEODEN faces his ENEMY!

                                     THEODEN
                         Death!

                                     ROHIRRIM
                              (6000 voices)
                         Death!...

               CLOSE ON: MERRY is swept up in the emotion... he whips out 
               his LITTLE SWORD!

                                     THEODEN
                         Death!

                                     MERRY
                         Death!

                                     EOWYN
                         Death!

                                     THEODEN
                              (yelling)
                         Death! Forth Eorlingas!

               ALL the HORNS of the ROHIRRIM burst BLAST upon BLAST!

               ANGLE ON: The 6000 ROHIRRIM move off, a great WALL of HORSES 
               and SPEAR POINTS, building up to a GALLOP like a rising tide, 
               as they CHARGE TOWARDS THE 50,000 ORCS!

               ANGLE ON: MERRY, wind blowing his hair, EOWYN'S ARM around 
               his chest... as he YELLS at the top of his lungs !

               ANGLE ON: GOTHMOG marshalling his troops.

                                     GOTHMOG
                         Fire!

               The first VOLLEY of ARROWS hit the ROHAN SOLDIERS... The 
               charge continues...

                                     THEODEN
                         Charge!

               The second VOLLEY... GOTHMOG watches in HORRIFIED AWE as the 
               ROHAN ADVANCE CONTINUES... SUDDEN FEAR runs through the ORC 
               and URUK-HAI assembled on PELENNOR FIELD... The ROHAN charge 
               like MEN POSSESSED!

               ANGLE ON: The WALL of ROHIRRIM HORSES and SPEARS is seemingly 
               unstoppable! Entire ORC COMPANIES vanish under their hooves, 
               like sand beneath a foaming breaker, as they RACE towards 
               the MAIN BODY of the ORC ARMY!

               ANGLES ON: ORC ARCHERS fire into the thundering ROHIRRIM...

               ORC SPEARS LOWER... then SUDDENLY the ROHIRRIM crash into 
               the ORCS and the screen is FILLED with hacking, SLASHING 
               SWORDS and CLASHING SHIELDS...

               ...A JAW-DROPPING SIGHT!

               EXT. MINAS TIRITH STREETS - DAWN

               ANGLE ON: PIPPIN rushes towards GANDALF, dodging FLAMING 
               DEBRIS.

                                     PIPPIN
                              (panicked yell)
                         Gandalf!

               GANDALF wheels around on SHADOWFAX...

                                     PIPPIN
                              (breathless)
                         Denethor has lost his mind! He's 
                         burning Faramir alive!

               GANDALF pulls PIPPIN onto SHADOWFAX.

                                     GANDALF
                         Come! Quickly!

               EXT. PELENNOR FIELDS - DAWN

               The ROHAN charge is decimating the ENEMY!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. MINAS TIRITH STEWARD'S TOMB - DAWN

               LOW ANGLE POV: DENETHOR standing on the table astride FARAMIR, 
               pouring OIL over his OWN HEAD... It runs through his hair 
               and down his face, quickly soaking his ROBES.

               CLOSE ON: FARAMIR, his eyes flicker open. As he tries to 
               FOCUS through his delirium, OIL splashes onto his CHEST and 
               FACE.

                                     DENETHOR
                         Set a fire in our flesh!

               BUNDLES of OIL-SOAKED wood are STACKED all around them.

               SERVANTS are holding FLAMING TORCHES, awaiting their orders... 
               DENETHOR nods to them:

               The SERVANTS approach the PYRE, TORCHES held firmly.

               AT THAT MOMENT: GANDALF and PIPPIN burst into the HALLOWS, 
               astride SHADOWFAX!

                                     GANDALF
                              (yelling)
                         Stay this madness!

               The fearful SERVANTS back away from the PYRE...

               CLOSE ON: With a ROAR, DENETHOR SNATCHES a FLAMING TORCH... 
               and HURLS it at the PYRE!

               WHOOSH! The PYRE IGNITES!

               ANGLE ON: GANDALF GALLOPS toward the PYRE, knocking DENETHOR 
               to his FEET... PIPPIN LEAPS from SHADOWFAX onto the BURNING 
               PYRE!

               With a desperate strength, PIPPIN pushes FARAMIR off the 
               BURNING PYRE... they tumble down the BUNDLES of WOOD, onto 
               the FLOOR! PIPPIN douses FLAMES on FARAMIR'S clothing.

               DENETHOR SCREAMS with RAGE!

                                     DENETHOR
                         No! Do not take my son from me!

               DENETHOR leaps ACROSS THE PYRE, RIPPING and TUGGING at PIPPIN! 
               FIRE quickly spreads up DENETHOR'S OIL-SOAKED BACK as he 
               hauls PIPPIN off FARAMIR!

               ANGLE ON: SHADOWFAX rears up and STRIKES at DENETHOR who 
               falls back onto the PYRE.

               CLOSE ON: DENETHOR... he looks into his SON'S eyes... for a 
               BRIEF MOMENT SANITY returns.

                                     DENETHOR
                              (whisper)
                         Faramir...

               ANGLE ON: FLAMES begin to ENGULF DENETHOR...

               CLOSE ON: GANDALF pulls PIPPIN to safety... they look in 
               HORROR as...

               SUDDENLY! DENETHOR lurches off the PYRE! Now a SCREAMING, 
               unguided BALL OF FLAME, he runs across the CHAMBER, 
               disappearing out of the door!

                                     CANDALF
                              (grimly)
                         So passes Denethor, Son of Ecthelion.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MINAS TIRITH - DAY

               DENETHOR runs across the WHITE COURT atop MINAS TIRITH... 
               and PLUMMETS straight over the 700 FOOT SHEER DROP into the 
               FLAMING CITY below!

               EXT. PELENNOR FIELDS - DAY

               PAN OFF: DENETHOR'S DEATH PLUNGE to the ROHIRRIM gaining the 
               upper hand -- VAST NUMBERS of ORCS are SLAIN, or are FLEEING!

                                     EOMER
                         Drive them into the river!

               THEODEN STANDS PROUD in his saddle, YELLING to his ROHIRRIM!

                                     THEODEN
                              (yelling)
                         Make safe the city!

               CLOSE ON: THEODEN... his look of JOY turns to HORROR!

               ANGLE ON: Across the VAST SEA of BATTLE come...

               ...20 MUMAKIL! MASSIVE elephant-like CREATURES, each carrying 
               a WAR-TOWER, packed with HARADRIM ARCHERS!

               ANGLE ON: ROHIRRIM RIDERS PANICKING.

               CLOSE ON: THEODEN on his HORSE, CIRCLING AMONGST THEM.

                                     THEODEN
                         Reform the line... Reform the line!

               ANGLE ON: ROHIRRIM HORSES MOVING BACK INTO LINE.

                                     THEODEN
                              (to GAMLING)
                         Sound the charge!
                              (sword raised)
                         ...Charge!

               ANGLE ON: ROHIRRIM RIDERS CHARGE TOWARDS THE LINE OF MUMAKIL!

               ANGLES ON: The MUMAKIL BELLOW as they are goaded into war, 
               driven mercilessly by their brutal HARADRIM MASTERS. They 
               LUMBER into the SEA of MEN, crushing RIDERS and HORSES beneath 
               their MASSIVE FEET! Their SPIKED TUSKS swing wildly, sweeping 
               and impaling RIDERS!

               HARADRIM ARCHERS are sending a RAIN of ARROWS into the 
               PANICKING ROHIRRIM!

               EOWYN and MERRY are THROWN from their HORSE...

               EXT. MINAS TIRITH - DAWN

               HIGH WIDE: The SIXTH LEVEL of the CITY... Smoke rising around 
               it, fires burning beneath it...

               EXT. THE SIXTH GATE, MINAS TIRITH - DAWN

               WIDE ON: A rabble of ORCS are clustered outside the SIXTH 
               GATE as TROLLS pound on its WOODEN DOORS with HUGE HAMMERS.

               ANGLE ON: WOOD splinters... The DOORS are near breaking point.

               ANGLE ON: GANDALF and PIPPIN sit on stone steps... Both 
               covered in sweat and grime, bone-weary from fighting, spirits 
               and hearts bruised...

               PIPPIN looks towards the WOODEN GATES at which a NUMBER of 
               SOLDIERS continue to build a BARRICADE...

                                     PIPPIN
                              (quiet)
                         I didn't think it would end this 
                         way...

               GANDALF looks at the SMALL HOBBIT a beat.

                                     GANDALF
                              (gently)
                         End? No, the journey doesn't end 
                         here.

               PIPPIN looks up at GANDALF, questioningly...

                                     GANDALF
                         Death is just another path, one that 
                         we all must take.

               ANGLE ON: GANDALF looks down to see PIPPIN looking up at him 
               with fear in his eyes...

                                     GANDALF
                              (remembering)
                         The grey rain curtain of this world 
                         rolls back and all turns to silver 
                         glass...
                              (to himself)
                         and then you see it...

               ANGLE ON: GANDALF breaks off, lost in reverie...

                                     PIPPIN
                         What, Gandalf? See what?

                                     GANDALF
                         White shores... And beyond... A far 
                         green country under a swift sunrise.

               PIPPIN stares up at the OLD WIZARD'S FACE, softened, quiet 
               and full of peace...

                                     PIPPIN
                              (quiet)
                         Well, that isn't so bad.

                                     GANDALF
                              (gently)
                         No... No, it isn't.

               BOOM!

               ANGLE ON: GANDALF and PIPPIN'S faces turn as the WOODEN DOORS 
               shudder under another BLOW.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PELENNOR FIELDS - DAY

               ANGLE ON: The battlefield is in CHAOS as MUMAKIL decimate 
               the VALIANT ROHIRRIM...

               CLOSE ON: THEODEN tries to rally his men amid the SEA of 
               CRYING MEN and NEIGHING HORSES!

                                     THEODEN
                              (yelling)
                         Rally to me! To me!

               SUDDENLY the WITCH-KING SWOOPS down on his NAZGUL scooping 
               up THEODEN and his HORSE... they CARTWHEEL into the AIR and 
               land in a heap... the HORSE is DEAD... THEODEN lies DYING 
               beneath it.

               ANGLE ON: The WITCH-KING swooping down on his FELL-BEAST!

               The FELL-BEAST lands on THEODEN'S DEAD HORSE.

                                     WITCH-KING
                         Feast on his flesh!

               ANGLE ON: The FELL-BEAST opens it's WICKED JAWS...!

               ANGLE ON: A ROHAN SOLDIER stands before the BEAST... it is 
               EOWYN!

                                     EOWYN
                         I will kill you if you touch him!

               CLOSE ON: The WITCH-KING laughs...

                                     WITCH-KING
                         Do not come between the Nazgul and 
                         his prey!

               ANGLE ON: The FELL-BEAST lifts EOWYN from her feet...

               SUDDENLY! With a mighty SWORD BLOW, the FELL-BEAST'S HEAD is 
               SEVERED! The huge CREATURE crumples to the ground, VAST WINGS 
               out-stretched, sending the WITCH-KING sprawling!

               ANGLE ON: The WITCH-KING rises out of the wreckage... tall 
               and threatening...

               EOWYN stands before him, the FELL-BEAST'S BLOOD dripping 
               from her SWORD!

               With a shrill SHRIEK of HATRED, he knocks EOWYN backwards 
               with his MACE! STUNNED, EOWYN tries to stand and is hit once 
               again with another CRIPPLING BLOW...

               ANGLE ON: The WITCH-KING laughs once again as he SMASHES his 
               MACE downward... EOWYN tries to block the BLOW but her SHIELD 
               shatters into MANY PIECES!

               The WITCH-KING towers over EOWYN... raising his MACE for the 
               KILLING BLOW!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MINAS TIRITH DOCKS - DAY

               ANGLE ON: an ORC COMMANDER hurrying on to the ANDUIN RIVER 
               DOCKS, close to the CITY. LARGE BLACK SHADOWS slide across 
               the DOCKS, as SAILING SHIPS approach O.S.

               ANGLE ON: A sinister BLACK SAILED SHIP GLIDES into the 
               DOCKS... 9 OTHER CORSAIR SHIPS follow behind.

               CLOSE ON: The ORC COMMANDER...

                                     ORC COMMANDER
                              (angry)
                         Late as usual! Get off your ships, 
                         you sea rats! There's knife work 
                         here needs doing.

               ANGLE ON: ARAGORN leaping from the LEADING SHIP and charging 
               across the DOCKS, ROARING at the top of his LUNGS! He is 
               followed by LEGOLAS and GIMLI...

               ANGLE ON: Surprised ORC REACTION to the THREE charging towards 
               THOUSANDS of ORCS!

                                     GIMLI
                         Plenty for the both of us... May the 
                         best dwarf win!

               ANGLE ON: The ARMY OF THE DEAD suddenly LEAP straight out of 
               the SIDES of the SHIPS! They charge ACROSS the SURFACE OF 
               THE WATER with FRIGHTENING SPEED, overtaking ARAGORN!

               The ORCS SCREAM at the SIGHT of 5000 SPECTRAL WARRIORS!

               ANGLE ON: The SPECTRAL WARRIORS SWARM into the flank of the 
               ORC ARMY! With a raging blood-lust, the UNDEAD climb over 
               the top of each other to try and reach the enemy, creating a 
               kind of ROLLING MOUNTAIN of GHOULS that sweep all before 
               them away!

               The ORCS have no defence as their WEAPONS CANNOT MAKE CONTACT 
               with the GHOSTS!

               EXT. PELENNOR FIELDS - DAY

               ANGLE ON: MERRY on the ground... He looks around to see THE 
               WITCH-KING standing over EOWYN, pulling her to her FEET!

                                     WITCH KING
                         No man can kill me... Die!

               ANGLE ON: MERRY driving his SWORD into the back of the 
               WITCHKING'S KNEE! MERRY'S SWORD bursts into FLAME and his 
               ARM is shot with PAIN...

               EOWYN struggles to her feet... pulling off her HELMET.

               CLOSE ON: EOWYN... her LONG HAIR tumbling onto her shoulders!

                                     EOWYN
                         I am no man!

               With her last strength, EOWYN thrusts her SWORD into the 
               WITCH-KING'S FACE! EOWYN'S SWORD SHATTERS into MANY SHARDS!

               The WITCH-KING topples back DEAD, a BLACK OOZE leaking from 
               his ROBES and ARMOUR! A shuddering CRY, fading into a SHRILL 
               WAIL passes with the WIND.

               ARAGORN and LEGOLAS battle the ORC -- LEGOLAS JUMPS onto the 
               BACK of a GIANT MUMAKIL bringing it down... he lands on his 
               feet in front of GIMLI...

                                     GIMLI
                         That still only counts as one!

               The MUMAKIL react with terror as SPECTRAL WARRIORS climb up 
               their SIDES, routing the HARADRIM from their WAR-TOWERS!

               ORCS flee in their THOUSANDS... the TERRIFIED MUMAKIL 
               trampling them in their PANIC to ESCAPE!

               ANGLE ON: The ARMY OF THE DEAD swarming over the CITY, routing 
               the ORCS!

               ANGLE ON: EOWYN crawls to where THEODEN lays, mortally 
               wounded...

               THEODEN looks up at EOWYN... his breathing shallow... his 
               vision clouded...

                                     THEODEN
                              (gasping weakly)
                         I know your face... Eowyn...

               EOWYN smiles down at him as she GENTLY STROKES his FACE...

                                     THEODEN
                         My eyes darken...

                                     EOWYN
                         No... I am going to save you...

                                     THEODEN
                              (loving)
                         You already did...
                              (clutching her hand)
                         My body is broken... you have to let 
                         me go.

                                     EOWYN
                         No...

               THEODEN touches her tear-stained face...

                                     THEODEN
                         I go to my fathers... in whose mighty 
                         company, I shall not now feel 
                         ashamed...

               THEODEN is DYING...

                                     THEODEN
                         Eowyn?

               THEODEN DIES... EOWYN breaks down, SOBBING... ALL AROUND is 
               a VISTA OF DEFEAT.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PELENNOR FIELDS, MINAS TIRITH - DAY

               WIDE ON: PELENNOR FIELDS... strangely SILENT... all ORCS 
               have fled... BATTLE DEBRIS and BODIES stretch as far as the 
               eye can see...

               ABOVE MINAS TIRITH... BLINDING SUN RAYS break through the 
               LOW CLOUDS!

               ANGLE ON: GANDALF, LEGOLAS, GIMLI and PIPPIN watch as...

               ARAGORN walks slowly across the FIELD OF BATTLE towards the 
               HIDEOUS GHOULS...

                                     KING OF THE DEAD
                         Release us.

                                     GIMLI
                              (quietly)
                         Bad idea. Very handy in a tight spot, 
                         these lads -- despite the fact, 
                         they're dead!

                                     KING OF THE DEAD
                         You gave us your word.

                                     ARAGORN
                         I hold your oath fulfilled... Go. Be 
                         at peace.

               ANGLE ON: The ARMY OF THE DEAD slowly DISSOLVE INTO DUST, 
               and are immediately swept away by the four winds.

               ARAGORN turns to GANDALF who bows his head in HOMAGE...

               PIPPIN, in his GONDORIAN armour, looks around at the 
               devastation... his eyes full of SADNESS... they suddenly fix 
               on something.

               ANGLE ON: PIPPIN running through the RUIN of the BATTLE...

               towards a SMALL FIGURE slumped on the ground...

                                     PIPPIN
                         Merry...?

               MERRY stares unseeing at PIPPIN... HORROR and SHOCK erasing 
               all other memories from MERRY'S mind... tears fall down 
               PIPPIN'S FACE as he looks on his FRIEND...

                                     PIPPIN
                         Merry... it's me, it's Pippin...

                                     MERRY
                              (groggy)
                         I knew you'd find me.
                              (disorientated)
                         Are you going to leave me?

                                     PIPPIN
                         No Merry, I'm going to look after 
                         you.

               ANGLE ON: PIPPIN covers MERRY with a blanket...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TOWER OF CIRITH UNGOL - NIGHT

               CAMERA RISES... towards the dark ORC TOWER of CIRITH UNGOL.

               A light glows from the TOPMOST WINDOW.

               CAMERA reaches the TOWER, dissolving through the wall into...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TOWER OF CIRITH UNGOL/TOP ROOM - NIGHT

               ...a small cold ROOM. FRODO BAGGINS is UNCONSCIOUS on the 
               floor. His eyes suddenly flicker and he WAKES UP.

               TILT UP... to reveal the ORC and URUK-HAI, GORBAG and SHAGRAT, 
               arguing over FRODO'S BELONGINGS and CLOTHES! GORBAG is 
               snatching for the MITHRIL VEST.

                                     SHAGRAT
                         Hey! Hands off -- that shiny shirt, 
                         that's mine.

                                     GORBAG
                         It's going to the Great Eye, along 
                         with everything else...

               ANGLE ON: FRODO as he realizes that he has been STRIPPED 
               down to his UNDERWEAR. He clutches at his throat.

               ...The RING HAS GONE!

                                     SHAGRAT
                         I don't take orders from stinking 
                         Morgul rats!

               GORBAG grabs for the MITHRIL VEST...

                                     GORBAG
                              (angry yell)
                         You touch it, and I'll stick this 
                         blade in your guts!

               ANGLE ON: GORBAG draws his SWORD, but SHAGRAT KICKS him 
               BACKWARDS with his foot! GORBAG FALLS THROUGH a TRAP DOOR 
               leading to the floor below!

                                                                    CUT TO:

               INT. TOWER OF CIRITH UNGOL/GUARD ROOM - NIGHT

               ANGLE ON: GORBAG lands in the GUARD ROOM with a CRASH, 
               creating SUDDEN ALARM amongst the ORCS and URUK-HAI stationed 
               there.

               SHAGRAT leans through the TRAP DOOR...

                                     SHAGRAT
                              (yelling)
                         The scum tried to knife me! Kill 
                         him!

               SEVERAL URUK-HAI converge on GORBAG -- he LASHES OUT, slashing 
               one across the throat with his SWORD!

               The DEAD URUK-HAI topples backwards over the PARAPET...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TOWER OF CIRITH UNGOL/COURTYARD - NIGHT

               ...landing on top of URUK-HAI and ORCS in the courtyard below. 
               Within moments, a brutal CIVIL WAR breaks out between the 
               TWO COMPANIES stationed in CIRITH UNGOL!

               EXT. PASS OF CIRITH UNGOL - NIGHT

               ANGLE ON: SAM hurries towards the gate, fearful for FRODO.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. TOWER OF CIRITH UNGOL/COURTYARD - NIGHT

               SAM is confronted with the sight of over 50 SLAUGHTERED ORC 
               and URUK-HAI, strewn over the COURTYARD!

               ANGLE ON: SAM pounds UP THE STAIRCASE... he suddenly PAUSES.

               SEVERAL URUK-HAI are running DOWN TOWARDS HIM! He grips STING 
               and continues CHARGING UP -- SCREAMING at the top of his 
               lungs!

               ANGLE ON: The FOUR URUKS... they see a HUGE DISTORTED SHADOW 
               on the wall in front of them! They turn around and flee in 
               terror back to the top of the stairs!

               SAM appears -- and before the URUK-HAI can fully regain their 
               wits -- he slays THREE... YELLING:

                                     SAM
                              (Yelling... 1st URUK-
                              HAI)
                         That's for Frodo!
                              (yelling... 2nd URUK-
                              HAI)
                         And for the Shire!
                              (yelling... 3rd URUK-
                              HAI)
                         And that's for my old Gaffer!

               SAM runs into the TOWER...

               INT. TOWER OF CIRITH UNGOL/TOP ROOM - NIGHT

               ANGLE ON: FRODO struggling against his bonds, as GORBAG climbs 
               back into the room... with VENGEANCE in his EVIL EYES.

                                     GORBAG
                         Stop your squeaking you dunghill 
                         rat!

               CLOSE ON: GORBAG grabs FRODO'S hair and pulls his head back, 
               exposing his neck. He pulls out his SWORD, ready to cut 
               FRODO'S throat...

                                     GORBAG
                         I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck 
                         pig!

               SUDDENLY! GORBAG GASPS as STING is rammed into his back by 
               SAM!

                                     SAM
                         Not if I stick you first!

               GORBAG falls dead!

                                     FRODO
                              (joyous disbelief)
                         Sam!!!

               ANGLE ON: FRODO... humbled by SAM'S unswerving loyalty.

                                     FRODO
                         Oh, Sam... I'm so sorry... sorry for 
                         everything.

               SAM quickly cuts FRODO free.

                                     SAM
                         Come on.

                                     FRODO
                              (despairing)
                         It's too late. It's over... they've 
                         taken it. Sam -- they took the Ring!!

                                     SAM
                              (quietly)
                         Begging your pardon, but they haven't.

               SAM pulls the RING from his pocket...

                                     SAM
                         I thought I'd lost you... so I took 
                         it -- only for safe-keeping.

               CLOSE ON: FRODO looks at SAM amazed... his eyes drop to the 
               RING...

                                     FRODO
                         Give it to me.

               SAM hesitates... TENSION instantly builds between them.

                                     FRODO
                         Give me the Ring, Sam.

               SAM seems strangely reluctant... ON THE SOUNDTRACK to HUM of 
               the RING builds

                                     FRODO
                         Sam! Give me the Ring.

               CLOSE ON: SAM drops the RING into FRODO'S palm...

               FRODO sags in RELIEF... He puts the RING back around his 
               neck...

                                     FRODO
                         You must understand... The Ring is 
                         my burden... It will destroy you, 
                         Sam.

               FRODO looks at SAM, pain in his eyes...

               SAM looks down at FRODO... his plain HOBBIT face full of 
               compassion. SAM'S resolve hardens, a new strength takes hold.

                                     SAM
                         Come on, Mr. Frodo, we'd best find 
                         you some clothes... you can't go 
                         walking through Mordor in naught but 
                         your skin.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PASS OF CIRITH UNGOL - NIGHT

               FRODO and SAM are now dressed in FOUL-LOOKING ORC gear...

               ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM turn east and walk over the SUMMIT 
               of CIRITH UNGOL... into MORDOR.

               CLOSE ON: FRODO and SAM... they STOP DEAD... STARING AHEAD:

               ANGLE ON: MOUNT DOOM... 50 MILES AWAY -- across the barren 
               GORGOROTH PLATEAU -- the mountain is erupting streams of ASH 
               and LAVA high into the air, lighting the low cloud blanket 
               of MORDOR with a flickering ORANGE WASH.

               With immense trepidation, FRODO and SAM head down the steep 
               path into the dark kingdom...

               ...TWO TINY FIGURES in a bleak, foreboding landscape. Before 
               them lies the PLAIN of GORGOROTH... Their eyes are drawn to 
               the OMINOUS SILHOUETTE of MOUNT DOOM...

                                     SAM
                         We did it, Mr. Frodo. We made it to 
                         Mordor.

               ANGLE ON: FRODO's eyes travel down towards the HUNDREDS of 
               FIRES which glow on the PLAINS beneath them... thousands 
               upon thousands of ORCS are encamped there.

                                     FRODO
                         There are so many of them... So many. 
                         We'll never get through unseen.

               THEIR eyes are drawn to a DARK LOOMING SHAPE... BARAD-DUR... 
               A RED LIGHT seems to sweep across the PLAIN...

                                     FRODO
                              (terror)
                         It's him -- the Eye.

               The GREAT EYE OF SAURON!

               SAM cannot see what FRODO sees. GENTLY, he urges FRODO on.

                                     SAM
                         We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo. 
                         There's nothing for it. Come on. 
                         Let's just make it down the hill for 
                         starters.

               EXT. MINAS TIRITH, TOWER HALL - DAY

               CLOSE ON: GANDALF stands in the TOWER HALL... seemingly 
               alone... he speaks quietly, doubt and fear edge his voice.

                                     GANDALF
                         Frodo has passed beyond my sight. 
                         The darkness is deepening.

               He turns and crosses the HALL to reveal the presence of GIMLI, 
               LEGOLAS, EOMER and ARAGORN...

               ARAGORN, his back to GANDALF...

                                     ARAGORN
                         If Sauron had the Ring, we would 
                         know it.

               CLOSE ON: GANDALF -- still troubled, still worried...

                                     GANDALF
                         It's only a matter of time. He has 
                         suffered a defeat, yes, but behind 
                         the walls of Mordor our enemy is 
                         regrouping.

               GIMLI sits insolently on the SEAT of the STEWARD...

                                     GIMLI
                         Let him stay there. Let him rot. Why 
                         should we care?

               GANDALF looks across at the DWARF... His face ashen.

                                     GANDALF
                         Because ten thousand Orcs now stand 
                         between Frodo and Mount Doom.
                              (to himself)
                         I have sent him to his death.

               ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns around suddenly...

                                     ARAGORN
                         No.

               GANDALF looks up sharply at ARAGORN...

                                     ARAGORN
                         There is still hope for Frodo. He 
                         needs time and safe passage across 
                         the Plains of Gorgoroth. We can give 
                         him that.

                                     GANDALF
                         How?

                                     ARAGORN
                         Draw out Sauron' s armies -- empty 
                         his lands. Then we gather our full 
                         strength and march on the Black Gate.

               At this, GIMLI CHOKES on his pipe... EOMER steps forward.

                                     EOMER
                         We cannot achieve victory from 
                         strength of arms.

                                     ARAGORN
                         Not for ourselves... But we can give 
                         Frodo his chance if we keep Sauron's 
                         eye fixed upon us. Keep him blind to 
                         all else that moves.

                                     LEGOLAS
                         A diversion...

               CLOSE ON: GANDALF speaks in a low tone to ARAGORN...

                                     GANDALF
                              (doubtful)
                         Sauron will suspect a trap. He will 
                         not take the bait!

                                     GIMLI
                         Certainty of death. Small chance of 
                         success. What are we waiting for?

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PELENNOR FIELDS - DUSK

               CLOSE ON: ARAGORN wearing a BREAST PLATE emblazoned with the 
               WHITE TREE.

               He rides at the head of a COLUMN of 500 FOOT SOLDIERS from 
               ROHAN and GONDOR... leading them from the RUINS of OSGILIATH.

               GANDALF, LEGOLAS, GIMLI, EOMER, MERRY and PIPPIN ride directly 
               behind him.

               AHEAD OF THEM: The MOUNTAINS of MORDOR.

               EXT. PLAINS OF GORGORTH - NIGHT

               GREAT ARMIES of ORC and URUK-HAI stream across the PLAINS 
               from MORDOR...

               EXT. ORC ROAD, MORDOR - NIGHT

               WIDE SHOT: The VOLCANIC WASTELAND of the GORGOROTH FOOTHILLS.

               FRODO and SAM, still disguised in the ORC ARMOUR, slide down 
               scree bank and land on the road below... their attention is 
               fixed on the PLAIN below... thousands of ORCS can be seen 
               marching away from MT. DOOM...

                                     SAM
                         Look, the Orcs! They're moving off. 
                         You see, Mr. Frodo -- some luck at 
                         last.

               EXT. GORGOROTH PLAIN, MORDOR - DAWN

               FRODO and SAM... moving across a HELLISH dry landscape of 
               twisted volcanic rock and STEAMING FISSURES.

               40 MILES AWAY, MOUNT DOOM rises out of the PLAIN... its feet 
               founded in ashen ruin, its huge cone rising to a great height, 
               where its reeking head is swathed in cloud.

               EXT. BLACK GATES OF MORDOR - DAY

               ARAGORN'S FORCE of 500 approaches the great BLACK GATES OF 
               MORDOR. He positions his troops about half a mile from the 
               GATES.

               EXT. GORGOROTH PLAIN, MORDOR - DAY

               ANGLE ON: FRODO slumped against a ROCK... he tries to DRINK 
               from his WATER BOTTLE... but finds it EMPTY.

                                     SAM
                         Take mine... there's a few drops 
                         left.

               FRODO gratefully takes a SMALL SIP from SAM'S BOTTLE... hands 
               it back.

                                     FRODO
                         There'll be none left for the return 
                         journey.

                                     SAM
                              (softly)
                         I don't think there will be a return 
                         journey, Mr. Frodo.

               A moment of EYE CONTACT between FRODO and SAM as they 
               acknowledge what lies ahead.

               SAM offers FRODO his hand... and PULLS HIM UP.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. BLACK GATES OF MORDOR - DAY

               At the BLACK GATES, ARAGORN musters his MEN...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. PLAINS OF GORGOROTH - DAY

               WIDE ON: FRODO and SAM staggering across the TORTURED 
               LANDSCAPE... they are no longer WEARING the ORC ARMOUR.

               CLOSE ON: FRODO is walking half-bowed, often stumbling... as 
               if his eyes not longer see the way before his feet.

               His right HAND is pressed against his CHEST... supporting a 
               HEAVY WEIGHT. His left HAND often rises, as if to ward off 
               some invisible blow. SAM watches him, CONCERN etched across 
               his FACE...

               CLOSE ON: FRODO as a malevolent VOICE in his head calls to 
               him... "Baggins -- Baggins"...

               CLOSE ON: SAM looking behind him in time to see...

               WIDE ON: A RAY of RED LIGHT stabs through the GLOOM and begins 
               to sweep over the BARREN LANDSCAPE...

                                     SAM
                         Frodo, get down!

               SAM throws himself to the ground... FRODO turns to the light, 
               unable to stop himself...

               FRODO crumpling to the ground as the RED LIGHT hits him like 
               a SEARCHLIGHT.

               EXT. BLACK GATES OF MORDOR - NIGHT

               All is QUIET... No sign of the ENEMY...

                              (wary)
                         Where are they?

               ANGLE ON: GANDALF... watchful... alert. He nods at ARAGORN.

               WIDE: ARAGORN, GANDALF, LEGOLAS, GIMLI, EOMER, MERRY and 
               PIPPIN galloping towards the BLACK GATES. They pull up less 
               than 50 yards from the TOWERING GATES...

               FRODO is slumped on the GROUND, unable to MOVE...

               EXT. BLACK GATES OF MORDOR - NIGHT

               ANGLE ON: ARAGORN moves his HORSE forward.

                                     ARAGORN
                         Let the lord of the Black Land come 
                         forth; let justice be done upon him.

               From behind the HUGE GATES, the terrifying CHANTING and the 
               CLANGING of the ARMOUR of THOUSANDS...

               With the SOUND of TORTURED METAL, the MASSIVE GATES begin to 
               open... LEGOLAS, MERRY and EOMER look on in trepidation.

               EXT. PLAINS OF GORGOROTH - NIGHT

               With the EYE OF SAURON sweeping the PLAINS around them, SAM 
               gets to his feet...

               EXT. BLACK GATES OF MORDOR - NIGHT

               The BLACK GATES of MORDOR SWING OPEN! SAURON'S ARMY of 300,000

               ANGLE ON: ARAGORN, GANDALF, LEGOLAS, GIMLI, EOMER, MERRY and 
               PIPPIN GALLOP back towards their SMALL ARMY as the ORC MASSES 
               slowly MARCH toward them.

               Behind them, the EYE OF SAURON is directed toward THEM...

                                                                    CUT TO:

                         It's gone, Mr. Frodo.

               ANGLE ON: SAM crawls toward FRODO...

                                     SAM
                         The light's passed on, away towards 
                         the North... something's drawn it's 
                         gaze.

               FRODO and SAM stagger to their feet and move off.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANGLE ON: The MASSIVE ORC ARMY marching towards ARAGORN'S 
               MEN.

               ANGLES ON: ARAGORN'S MEN... starting to WAVER as the ORCS 
               ENCIRCLE THEM. SOME MEN are backing away... losing their 
               nerve.

               ARAGORN GALLOPS in front of his ARMY...

                                     ARAGORN
                         Hold your ground -- hold your ground! 
                         Sons of Gondor -- of Rohan... my 
                         brothers!

               ANGLE ON: ARAGORN... he seems to fix each and everyone of 
               his MEN with his eyes.

                                     ARAGORN
                         I see in your eyes the same fear 
                         that would take the heart of me. The 
                         day may come when the courage of Men 
                         fails; when we forsake our friends 
                         and break all bonds of fellowship; 
                         but it is not this day -- an hour of 
                         wolves and shattered shields, when 
                         the Age of Man comes crashing down -- 
                         but it is not this day!!! This day 
                         we fight! By all that you hold dear 
                         on this good earth -- I bid you stand!

               ARAGORN holds ANDURIL ALOFT!

               FRODO and SAM are CLIMBING the face of MOUNT DOOM...

               The LANDSCAPE is VIOLENT... RED HEAT hisses out of FISSURES, 
               the ROCK is JAGGED... RAZOR SHARP... ASH blankets the LAND.

               RED LIGHTNING FORKS across the SKY with a DEAFENING CRACK!

               CLOSE ON: FRODO and SAM'S FEET dragging across the ASH...

               Their PARCHED LIPS... SWEATING, DUSTY FACES.

               FRODO TRIPS... falls FACE-FIRST into the DUST... SAM drops 
               beside him.

               FRODO slowly lifts his head and looks up...

               FRODO'S POV: Looking .straight up the STEEP SLOPES of MOUNT 
               DOOM! ...a huge mass of ash and slag and burned stone!

               FRODO starts to CRAWL on his HANDS and KNEES! He hauls himself 
               a FEW PITIFUL FEET before SLUMPING in the ASH.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANGLE ON: GIMLI as he surveys the ARMY of MORDOR...

                                     GIMLI
                         Never thought I'd die fighting side 
                         by side with an Elf.

                                     LEGOLAS
                              (quietly)
                         What about side by side with a friend?

               GIMLI looks up into the EYES of LEGOLAS, with whom he has 
               shared so much. The GRUFF DWARF smiles quietly...

                                     GIMLI
                         Aye -- I could do that.

               LEGOLAS drops his hand on GIMLI'S shoulder... SLOWLY they 
               turn and FACE the ENEMY TOGETHER.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               CLOSE ON: SAM crawls to FRODO who lies SLUMPED against the

                                     SAM
                              (softly)
                         Do you remember the Shire, Mr. Frodo? 
                         ...It'll be spring soon, and the 
                         orchards will be in blossom; and the 
                         birds will be nesting in the hazel 
                         thicket; and they'11 be sowing the 
                         summer barley in the lower fields; 
                         and eating the first of the 
                         strawberries with cream.
                              (looking down at FRODO)
                         Do you remember the taste of 
                         strawberries?

               CLOSE ON: FRODO shuts his eyes, his breath coming in GASPS.

                              (weak whisper)
                         No, Sam. I can't recall the taste of 
                         food; nor the sound of water; nor 
                         the touch of grass... I'm naked in 
                         the dark.
                              (rising panic)
                         There's no veil between me and the 
                         wheel of fire. I can see it with my 
                         waking eyes.

               CLOSE ON: SAM looks at FRODO with GRIM DETERMINATION.

                                     SAM
                         Then let us be rid of it -- once and 
                         for all! Come on, Mr. Frodo. I can't 
                         carry it for you... but I can carry 
                         you! Come on!

               With that, SAM lifts FRODO on to his shoulders and starts to 
               CLIMB MOUNT DOOM! His plain hobbit-face grows stern, almost 
               grim, as the will hardens in him.

               WIDE ON: TWO TINY HOBBITS on the ENDLESS shale SLOPES of the

               iron crown of BARAD-DUR, the Dark Tower, in the distance.

               CLOSE ON: SAM staggering under FRODO'S weight... STRONG ash-
               laden WINDS are buffeting him as he slowly CLIMBS MOUNT DOOM.

               The PLAIN of GORGOROTH lies 1000 FEET BELOW, wrapped in fume 
               and shadow.

               A TREMOR ripples through the GROUND... a RED FLAME explodes 
               into the SKY...

               ANGLE ON: SAM looks up -- fearful the MOUNTAIN could explode 
               at any moment!

               SAM POV: Through the THICK, FUME-LADEN AIR a set of STAIRS 
               can be made out...

                         Look, Mr Frodo! We're almost there!

               SAM can't believe it -- relief and joy flood through him...

                         Clever Hobbits to climb so high!

               SMACK! OUT OF NOWHERE the figure of SMEAGOL crashes into 
               them sending SAM and FRODO sprawling.

               ANGLE ON: SMEAGOL pounces on FRODO... his fingers wrapping 
               around his throat, snapping FRODO'S neck from side to side!

               ANGLE ON: FRODO as he struggles to unlock the BONY, WHITE 
               FINGERS around his neck but SMEAGOL'S grip is too strong.

               CLOSE ON: SMEAGOL'S fingers tightening around FRODO'S neck -- 
               squeezing the life out of him...

               WHACK! A ROCK connects with the SIDE of SMEAGOL'S head...

               ANGLE ON: SAM jumps on a STUNNED SMEAGOL...

               All the old HATRED between SAM and SMEAGOL boils over as 
               they FIGHT... SAM falls back... SMEAGOL BITING at his 
               SHOULDER!

               SAM pushes SMEAGOL away with his feet... rolls to his KNEES, 
               as SMEAGOL charges at him...

               SAM slashes out with STING! He cuts SMEAGOL across the 
               stomach! SMEAGOL staggers back, SCREAMING with PAIN...

               SAM looks around desperately for FRODO...

               CLOSE ON: GANDALF eyes flicker as a small MOTH flutters across 
               his line of sight.

               ANGLE ON: THE FELL BEAST -- JAWS OPEN, TALONS EXTENDED!

               Another cry rends the air as...

               SMACK! The GIANT EAGLE, GWAHIR, SMASHES into the FELLBEAST, 
               it's claws ripping into the HIDEOUS MONSTER'S NECK!

               ANGLE ON: PIPPIN in the midst of BATTLE looks up.

                                     PIPPIN
                              (disbelieving)
                         Eagles...

               Above the BATTLE attack formation, more EAGLES appear...

                                     PIPPIN
                         The Eagles are coming! The Eagles 
                         are coming!

               The EAGLES engage the NAZGUL!

               ANGLE ON: SAM is GASPING, his lungs EXPLODING as he RACES up 
               the SLOPES of MOUNT DOOM searching for FRODO.

               ANGLE ON: SAM arriving at the STONE DOORWAY of SAMMATH NAUR... 
               leading into the MOUNTAIN!

               ANGLE ON: SAM flinches against the FIERCE HEAT blasting down 
               the TUNNEL.

                              (yelling)
                         Frodo!

               SAM lurches forward... towards an ORANGE GLOW deep in the 
               HEART of the MOUNTAIN.

               INT. CRACK OF DOOM - DAY

               The HEAT is almost UNBEARABLE... SAM sees FRODO in the 
               DISTANCE...

                                     FRODO
                         I'm here, Sam.

               ANGLE ON: FRODO is standing on the EDGE of the CRACK OF 
               DOOM... a deep LAVA FILLED CHASM, in the very heart of ancient 
               SAURON'S FORGES, the greatest in Middle-earth.

               The RAGING ORANGE GLARE from the CHASM turns FRODO into a 
               BLACK SILHOUETTE... standing TENSE and STILL.

               FRODO holds the RING in his HAND... he RAISES IT, holding it 
               over the BUBBLING LAVA far below.

                                     SAM
                              (yelling)
                         Destroy it -- go on! Throw it in the 
                         fire!

               CLOSE ON: FRODO... a STRANGE EXPRESSION on his face...

                                     SAM
                         What are you waiting for? Just let 
                         it go!

               ON THE SOUNDTRACK: The HUM of the RING grows louder and 
               louder! FRODO PULLS the RING close to his body as he turns 
               to SAM.

               FRODO looks at SAM, the RING has finally taken him.

                                     FRODO
                         The Ring is mine.

               SAM SCREAMS as...

               ...FRODO PUTS THE RING ON! He VANISHES!

                                     SAM
                         No!

               been seen...

               SLOW MOTION: GOLLUM falls into the CRACK OF DOOM...

               INSTANTLY engulfed in the CHURNING LAVA!

               GOOD HAND!

               The CAVERNS are SHAKING VIOLENTLY.

                                     SAM
                         Give me your hand.

               FRODO struggles to reach SAM... he can't reach WITH HIS 
               BLEEDING hand, and falls back, still clinging valiantly to 
               the ROCK with his good hand...

                                     SAM

                              (desperate)

               EXT. BLACK GATES OF MORDOR - DAY

               The BLACK GATES collapse in a huge cloud of ASH!

               THE ORCS are FLEEING in all DIRECTIONS... As the very 
               foundations of MORDOR collapse!

               THE COMPANY watch as MOUNT DOOM explodes... the reason for 
               their MISERY is clear... it's plain FRODO and SAM can never 
               survive the cataclysm...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM stagger out of the SAMMATH NAUR 
               DOOR...

               All around ASH and MOLTEN ROCKS fall. The SKIES burst into 
               THUNDER, seared with LIGHTNING.

               The screaming NAZGUL fall from the sky in FLAMES!

               The ground is shaking so violently that FRODO and SAM can 
               barely stand.

               FRODO stumbles... SAM helps him up... FRODO smiles.

                                     FRODO
                         It's gone... It's done.

               SAM looks down at FRODO... FRODO'S FACE is at PEACE... his 
               BURDEN destroyed...

                                     SAM
                         Yes, Mr. Frodo... it's over now.

               FRODO and SAM crawl onto a ROCK as LAVA streams towards 
               them... in seconds THEIR ROCK is an island in a sea of MOLTEN 
               FIRE.

               FRODO shuts his eyes...

                                     FRODO

                         it would have been her... it would 
                         have been her.

               WIDE SHOT: The EAGLES bravely fly amid the RAINING ASH and 
               MOLTEN ROCKS... and SNATCH FRODO and SAM from the ROCK!

               CLOSE ON: FRODO'S FACE... as the FIERY VOLCANO recedes away 
               beneath him... the wind ruffles his hair... he PASSES OUT.

                         Gandalf?

               GANDALF'S face breaks into a smile... then laughter...

                         Now come the days of the King ...

               ARAGORN smiles up at GANDALF...

                                     GANDALF
                              (softly to Aragorn)
                         May they be blessed.

               ARAGORN slowly RISES, turning to face the CROWD, who CHEER 
               and CLAP for their KING...

                                     ARAGORN
                         This day does not belong to one man 
                         but to all. Let us together rebuild 
                         this world that we may share in the 
                         days of peace.

               The CHEERS of his PEOPLE are DEAFENING...

               ARAGORN sings for his people... Then WALKS in SLOW PROCESSION 
               down the WHITE PAVED PATH as the CROWD BOW their heads in 
               respect to their NEW KING...

               ARAGORN passes EOWYN and FARAMIR who bow before him... EOMER 
               steps FORWARD to bow in respect...

               TRUMPETS SOUND as a PROCESSION of ELVES, dressed in shimmering 
               SILVERS and WHITES, led by LEGOLAS approach the KING... 
               LEGOLAS gestures behind him...

               CLOSE ON: ARAGORN'S eyes scan amongst the ELVES.

               ANGLE ON: A BANNER carried aloft bearing the WHITE TREE of 
               GONDOR in FULL FLOWER... the RANKS of ELVES part revealing:

               ARWEN, eyes shining... MORTAL now, but deeply in love... 
               carrying the STANDARD of GONDOR... ARAGORN kisses her ELROND 
               looks on... his face breaks into a smile.

               ARAGORN and ARWEN embrace.

               ANGLE ON: ARAGORN and ARWEN walking through the CROWD towards 
               four SMALL FIGURES who stand nervously at the end of the 
               AVENUE...

               ANGLE ON: ARAGORN and ARWEN look on FRODO, SAM, MERRY and 
               PIPPIN, as they stand before them...

               The FOUR HOBBITS, dressed in their OLD CLOTHES, clean and 
               mended, bow their heads...

               ARAGORN raises his HAND.

                                     ARAGORN
                         My friends... you bow to no-one.

               ANGLE ON: ARAGORN drops on ONE KNEE, kneeling before THE 
               HOBBITS, his head bowed... followed by all assembled there.

               CLOSE ON: TEARS spring into FRODO'S EYES. He clutches SAM'S 
               shoulder as 4000 PEOPLE pay homage to the courage of two 
               little Hobbits from the Shire.

               CAMERA RISES INTO THE AIR... away from the CROWDED CITADEL, 
               until MINAS TIRITH becomes a SPECK in the LANDSCAPE...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. MIDDLE EARTH MAP - DAY

               DISSOLVING into the PARCHMENT MAP of MIDDLE-EARTH... Slowly 
               drifting across the MAP towards the WEST...

                                     FRODO (V.O.)
                         And thus it was a Fourth Age of Middle-
                         earth began, and the Fellowship of 
                         the Ring, though eternally bound by 
                         friendship and love, was ended. 
                         Thirteen months to the day since 
                         Gandalf sent us on our long journey...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HOBBITON - DUSK

                                     FRODO (V.O.)
                         ...we found ourselves looking upon a 
                         familiar sight... We were home!

               MATCHING MOVE: Revealing HOBBITON bathed in a WARM SUNSET...

               As FRODO, SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN ride into SHOT on PONIES... 
               past ODO PROUDFOOT who shakes his head at the STRANGENESS of 
               their appearance.

               INT. THE GREEN DRAGON INN - NIGHT

               FRODO brings a round of drinks to the TABLE.

               Nearby a HUGE FUSS is being made of a LARGE PUMPKIN which 
               has been brought in to be shown off.

               ANGLE ON: The FOUR FRIENDS look at each other. A WORLD of 
               experience now separates from their fellow HOBBITS.

               Seated at a long table, the FOUR FRIENDS raise their 
               glasses... SAM'S eye is suddenly caught!

               ANGLE ON: ROSIE COTTON who is serving behind the BAR...

               SAM steels himself and leaves to go and TALK to ROSIE...

               FRODO, MERRY and PIPPIN exchange smiles as...

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HOBBITON - DAY

               On a BEAUTIFUL sunny day, SAM and ROSIE are MARRIED... With 
               their dearest FRIENDS gathered around them...

               ROSIE throws a beautiful bouquet of FLOWERS... it's caught 
               by PIPPIN who smiles in embarrassment...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. BAG END - DAY

               FRODO walks through BAG END to his STUDY...

                                     FRODO (V.O.)
                         How do you pick up the threads of an 
                         old life? How do you go on, when in 
                         your heart you begin to understand. 
                         There is no going back. There are 
                         some things that time cannot mend. 
                         Some hurts that go too deep. That 
                         have taken hold.

               ANGLE ON: FRODO... from behind. He is HUNCHED over a DESK...

               PUSH IN: to reveal BILBO'S RED BOOK open on FRODO'S DESK.

               He is WRITING in the LAST CHAPTERS...

               In careful neat HANDWRITING. FRODO turns back the pages, 
               REVEALING: There and Back Again -- A Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo 
               Baggins. He writes below it as SAM GAMGEE calls out from the 
               door:

                                     SAM (O.S.)
                         Mr. Frodo?

               CLOSE ON: FRODO WINCES with a sharp GASP of PAIN... He puts 
               the PEN down and CLUTCHES at his SHOULDER...

               SAM has entered the ROOM and stands BEHIND FRODO...

                                     SAM
                              (concerned)
                         What is it?

               CLOSE ON: FRODO... He is DRAWN and PALE.

                                     FRODO
                         It's been four years to the day since 
                         Weathertop, Sam. It's never really 
                         healed.

               CLOSE ON: SAM... at a loss for words. His EYES fall to the 
               BOOK...

                                     SAM
                              (reading)

                         Tale, by Bilbo Baggins".

               TILT DOWN: to FRODO'S HANDWRITING:

                              (delighted)
                         You've finished it!

                              (closing the book)
                         Not quite... There's room for a little 
                         more.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. HOBBITON FIELDS - EARLY MORNING

               LYRICAL MUSIC OVER...

               A COLD WINTER'S MORNING... Out of the FOG rattles a SMALL 
               COVERED WAGON; GANDALF is at the REINS.

               ANGLE ON: FRODO, SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN are waiting on PONIES 
               for the WAGON... all are wearing their GREY ELVEN ROBES.

                                     FRODO (V.O.)
                         Bilbo once told me, the great stories 
                         never end -- that each of us must 
                         come and go in the telling. His part 
                         in this tale was now over. There 
                         would be no more journeys for Bilbo. 
                         Save one.

               CLOSE ON: GANDALF arrives in his CART...

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. WEST FARTHING - DAY

               WIDE ON: The WAGON trundles along at a SEDATE PACE.

               SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN ride behind, leading FRODO'S EMPTY 
               PONY.

                                     BILBO (O.S.)
                              (frail)
                         Tell me again, lad. Where are we 
                         going?

                                     FRODO (O.S.)
                         To the harbour, Bilbo. The Elves 
                         have accorded you a special honour. 
                         A place on the last ship to leave 
                         Middle-earth.

               INT. WAGON - DAY

               CLOSE ON: FRODO is SITTING in the WAGON... his ARM around 
               his UNCLE BILBO.

               BILBO is extremely OLD and FRAIL. He is DOZING... his head 
               slumped.

               BILBO'S eyes flutter OPEN... with effort he raises his head.

                                     BILBO
                              (frail)
                         Frodo... Any chance of seeing that 
                         old ring of mine... the one I gave 
                         you?

                                     FRODO
                              (quietly)
                         Sorry, Uncle... I'm afraid, I lost 
                         it.

                                     BILBO
                              (frail)
                         Oh... pity. I should like to have 
                         held it one last time.

               BILBO nods back to sleep... FRODO rests his head against 
               him.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               EXT. THE GREY HAVENS - DUSK

               ANGLE ON: FRODO, walking arm-in-arm with BILBO through a 
               beautiful ELVEN BOAT-HOUSE... GANDALF follows with MERRY, 
               PIPPIN and SAM.

               CLOSE ON: As BILBO looks up, he is STUNG by the BEAUTY before 
               him...

                                     BILBO
                         Oh! Well, here's a sight I have never 
                         seen before.

               TRACKING: Passing under a beautiful ELVEN ARCHWAY...

               ...to reveal a WHITE SHIP, ready to depart from a WHITE STONE 
               DOCK.

               ANGLE ON: ELROND, CELEBORN and GALADRIEL are waiting for 
               them.

               The SETTING SUN slowly dropping behind the SEA... visible 
               between the HEADLANDS of a beautiful INLET.

               The lighting is beautiful... SUN streams through the sails, 
               casting an ethereal glow on THE GROUP as they walk onto the 
               DOCK.

               BILBO bows in acknowledgement to ELROND, CELEBORN and 
               GALADRIEL, who return his GREETING.

                                     GALADRIEL
                         The power of the Three Rings is ended. 
                         The time has come for the Dominion 
                         of Men.

                                     ELROND
                              (ELVISH: with subtitles)
                         I Aear can ven na mar.
                         <The Sea calls us home.>

               ELROND holds out his ARMS to BILBO who suddenly seems MUCH 
               YOUNGER and SPRIGHTLIER... He sets off down the PATH TOWARD 
               his HOSTS...

                                     BILBO
                         I think I'm quite ready for another 
                         adventure.

               BILBO walks down toward the BOAT and BOARDS with ELROND...

               ANGLE ON: FRODO looks up... GALADRIEL is watching him. She 
               SMILES, TURNS and BOARDS the BOAT...

               GANDALF kneels before SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN -- who are all 
               looking TEARFUL.

                                     GANDALF
                         Farewell, my brave Hobbits. My work 
                         is now finished. Here at last, on 
                         the shores of the sea, comes the end 
                         of our Fellowship.

               There is GREAT SADNESS... MERRY SNIFFLES LOUDLY.

                                     GANDALF
                         I will not say: "do not weep", for 
                         not all tears are an evil.

               CLOSE ON: GANDALF turns and walks away... FRODO is DOWNCAST... 
               SUDDENLY, GANDALF turns and looks toward him.

                                     GANDALF
                         It is time, Frodo.

               ANGLE ON: GANDALF looks at FRODO then turns and slowly walks 
               towards the GANGPLANK to board the SHIP.

                                     SAM
                              (alarmed)
                         What does he mean?

               CLOSE ON: FRODO turns to SAM...

                                     FRODO
                              (gently)
                         We set out to save the Shire, and it 
                         has been saved... but not for me...

                                     SAM
                              (shaken)
                         You don't mean that -- you can't 
                         leave.

               ANGLE ON: SAM looks down... FRODO is holding BILBO'S RED 
               JOURNAL out towards him.

                                     FRODO
                         The last pages are for you, Sam.

               SAM is SOBBING... MERRY and PIPPIN are DISTRAUGHT...

               FRODO hugs MERRY and PIPPIN, and last of all SAM... and climbs 
               on board the SHIP.

               ANGLE ON: FRODO a look of WONDERMENT crosses his face... as 
               he STEPS FORWARD and ACCEPTS GANDALF'S HAND... finally 
               released from his pain, care falls from his face... he is 
               the young FRODO we first met so long ago.

               SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN comfort each other as the WHITE SHIP 
               glides away from the DOCK...

               WIDE ON: The WHITE BOAT sails away towards the HEADLANDS, 
               disappearing into the GOLDEN LIGHT of the SETTING SUN.

               ANGLE ON: SAM in growing darkness, still follows the departing 
               SHIP with his eyes, MERRY and PIPPIN are already preparing 
               to leave.

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXT. NO.3 BAGSHOT ROW - MORNING

               ANGLE ON: SAM walks up the path towards his house...

               A LITTLE GIRL toddles up to greet him.

                                     SAM
                         Elanor!

               He hugs his daughter...

                                     FRODO (V.O.)
                         My dear Sam. You cannot always be 
                         torn in two. You have to be one and 
                         whole for many years. You have so 
                         much enjoy and to be and to do. 
                         Because Sam, your part in the journey 
                         goes on.

               ANGLE ON: ROSIE COTTON steps up and kisses SAM on the cheek... 
               she gives him a TINY BABY BOY to cradle.

                                     SAM
                         Hello, little Frodo!

               ANGLE ON: SAM with his FAMILY... he draws a deep breath:

                                     SAM
                         Well... I'm back.

               SAM looks at his LOVELY FAMILY with GREAT HAPPINESS, tinged 
               with a little SADNESS...

               SAM and ROSIE take the CHILDREN'S HANDS and enter BAGSHOT... 
               the BRIGHT YELLOW DOORWAY closes behind them.

               FADE TO BLACK.

                                         THE END
